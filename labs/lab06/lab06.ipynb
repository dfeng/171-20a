    "In this lab we will begin working with abstracts of scientific articles. These abstracts are obtained from [arXiv.org](http://arxiv.org), an open access repository for e-prints of articles in scientific fields maintained by Cornell University. For example, [here is a not-so-random example](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06034) of an article that was posted to arXiv just yesterday. In this first lab, we will begin by building a vocabulary of tokens. We will then build topic models using the python library gensim, and do some analysis over the topics obtained.\n",

We will introduce the Counter class, an extension of dictionaries, as well as the concept of vocabularies, which are useful for using more powerful text processing techniques. We will also give a brief overview of topic models."

This frequency is determined in reference to a vocabulary of all words in the collection of documents.\n",

Recent works have demonstrated that heterogeneous degree and weight distributions have a significant influence on the epidemic dynamics. In this study, a novel edge-weight based compartmental approach is developed to estimate the epidemic threshold and epidemic size (final infected density) on networks with general degree and weight distributions, and a remarkable agreement with numerics is obtained. Even in complex network with the strong heterogeneous degree and weight distributions, this approach is worked. We then propose an edge-weight based removal strategy with different biases, and find that such a strategy can effectively control the spread of epidemic when the highly weighted edges are preferentially removed, especially when the weight distribution of a network is extremely heterogenous. The theoretical results from the suggested method can accurately predict the above removal effectiveness.\", \n",

    "  \"1407.0034\": \"We use cosmological simulations to assess how the explosion of the first stars in supernovae (SNe) influences early cosmic history. Specifically, we investigate the impact by SNe on the host systems for Population~III (Pop~III) star formation and explore its dependence on halo environment and Pop~III progenitor mass. We then trace the evolution of the enriched gas until conditions are met to trigger second-generation star formation. To this extent, we quantify the recovery timescale, which measures the time delay between a Pop~III SN explosion and the appearance of cold, dense gas, out of which second-generation stars can form. We find that this timescale is highly sensitive to the Pop~III progenitor mass, and less so to the halo environment. For Pop~III progenitor masses, $M_{\\\\ast}=15{{\\\\,M_\\\\odot}}$, $25{{\\\\,M_\\\\odot}}$, and $40{{\\\\,M_\\\\odot}}$ in a halo of $5\\\\times10^5{{\\\\,M_\\\\odot}}$, recovery times are $\\\\sim10$\\\\,Myr, $25$\\\\,Myr, and $90$\\\\,Myr, respectively. For more massive progenitors, including those exploding in pair instability SNe, second-generation star formation is delayed significantly, for up to a Hubble time. The dependence of the recovery time on the mass of the SN progenitor is mainly due to the ionizing impact of the progenitor star. Photoionization heating increases the gas pressure and initiates a hydrodynamical response that reduces the central gas density, an effect that is stronger in more massive. The gas around lower mass Pop~III stars remains denser and hence the SN remnants cool more rapidly, facilitating the subsequent re-condensation of the gas and formation of a second generation of stars. In most cases, the second-generation stars are already metal-enriched to $\\\\sim2-5\\\\times10^{-4}{{\\\\rm \\\\,Z_\\\\odot}}$, thus belonging to Population~II. The recovery timescale is a key quantity governing the nature of the first galaxies, able to host low-mass, long-lived stellar systems. These in turn are the target of future deep-field campaigns with the {\\\\it James Webb Space Telescope}.\", \n",
