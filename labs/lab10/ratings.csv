There was a slight hiss as I opened this legendary brew. I poured it into a tulip. It is totally still, and is a deep ruby color. The smell is of port, sherry, tobacco, and wood. This is extremely complex. 		The taste is good. It is of port and sherry first. There is a woody bite at the finish. Methinks this has yet to turn that corner from sugary to malty sweet. Do not misunderstand, this tastes great, but I think the best is yet to come. The mouthfeel is heavy, yet this flows down my gullet much more easily than a CA Cabernet, but not quite like a J.W. Lees Harvest Ale. Harvest Ale is the only beer that I have had that could possibly compare with this one. Otherwise, substitute this for a fine port or cognac. I will age my other specimens from this vintage a little longer. Or a lot longer. This is superb with my Romeo Y Julieta cigar. My new review reflects a more recent tasting, and it was paired with the mentioned cigar. 		2003 Edition: If anyone has ever had the privilege of viewing a Les Paul with a tobacco sunburst finish, this is pretty close to that in terms of looks. It smells more of ripe fruit than the 96. 		The taste is of port and sherry, as usual, but it is definitely young. This will be superb in about ten years. It is superb now, IMO. The mouthfeel is medium, but coating. I appreciate this beer more with every bottle that I imbibe. Score reflects 1996 vintage.		Serving type: bottle		Reviewed on: 07-13-2005 03:37:42",1203638400

It also looks different to the picture, as it has nothing to do with Sonoma Farmhouse. It just reads ""102.I.B.U.4.U"" at the top. Pours out deep golden, with an amber hue, it has a MASSIVE whit frothy head which grows and ends up towering above the glass, at least 3 fingers of bright white cloudy looking head, which eventually settles down to a finger and a half of dense foam. It looks very carbonated which worries me, at first. Aroma is medium resinous with floral and citrus character, some apricot, a touch of earth, lemon and light malty aromas to balance, a little touch of honeyedness. Flavour follows suit but with alot more of the hops coming through, and some ceral, grainy notes in there as well. First the beer enters with glue/resin, lemon juice, orange and spice, this all has a nice amount of sweetness which steadily recedes to leave more bitter pithy citrus rind, mixed with cereal flavours, honeyed malt and a touch of gassyness. Having said this though despite how fizzy the beer looks, its actually very creamy feeling on the tongue, so my earlier fears were quickly put to rest. The bitterness takes you into the finish which is nicely balanced and not too bitter, but fresh and refreshing with floral, ever so slightly perfumed notes making a return. Definitely the best Lagunitas beer I tried out of the three that I had, this is a lot better than the IPA and Maximus. But still, at the end of the day, it is nothing mind blowing, but a definite solid, pretty well balanced DIPA.",1282262400

Dry-hopping yields a profusion of apricot and tangerine scents. Mildly resiny. Carbonation is soft but extremely fuzzy. Grassy hop whispers unite with toasted hay flavors to lend an initially dull impression. Fresh apricot and tangerine notes soon arrive to provide some complexity, but the hops remain rather depthless. Tacky pockets of resins impart sporadic flashes of suppleness, though the fuzzy carbonation swiftly washes them away. Fairly airy and hollow at the center, and as the blandly haylike malts develop, the succulent hop aspects are significantly reduced. Finish leaves the palate yearning for more hop bitterness, as the soft hop flavors have now fled, leaving little more than a firm trail of nutty malts and crackery husks which deposit subtle sweetness. Pretty unpleasant in the mouth thanks to the ridiculously high level of filtration and fuzzy carbonation which is obviously forced.

Imagine my delight, therefore, when I found this brew, which I hadnt tried before...indeed hadnt even HEARD of before! Grabbing two bottles, I looked forward to getting home and enjoying another quality beer from one of Britains top brewers......The colours ok, nice burnt gold, but a lack of head lost it a vital point or two. It has an off-putting sugary/toffee aroma with a bit of marmalade thrown in too, not that nice. Its thin and unbalanced, cant say I picked up on the metallic notes, as mentioned by SilkTork, but it is quite unpleasant, harsh and acidic.

Too much bourbon really, I wish that there was some more variety in the barrel choices, I think that some port or red wine barrels would do some good things here.  Vanilla, charred oak, very noticable alcohol.  Theres just no smoothness or mellowness to this.  Finishes pretty hot with chocolate and burnt malts.  Mouthfeel is full and sturdy with a viscous texture, very heavy on the tongue.  Nice soft carbonation and a warming finish (Edge- FW10).  Overall, I just thought that this was a bit of a bourbon overkill.  It was actually pretty hard to finish the whole bottle.  This may age into something a little more pleasant though.  Way way below what I thought of the FW10, makes me wonder about the upcoming FW 12.",1225324800

Tartness and acidity then develop, adding a bit of lemon to the mix, with the initial sweet flavour again coming through in the finish.

6.5,48499,1158,Meantime London Porter,Porter,3/5,7/10,18/20,4/5,GarrettB,8/10,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 As the legend goes, the youthful, amicable brewery masterminds behind Flying Dog and Meantime once attended the same school.  These insouciant striplings socialized swimmingly, sauntering slowly through their school days, dreaming of silently sipping sipid suds.  When they matured and became masters of the keg they found that while their beerological interest was mutual their brewery locations were not.  One had opted for the bourgeoning city of Denver, the other for the bloated, bilgy city of London.  Their respective beers were exclusively proliferated near or around their own breweries.  These two brew masters then decided to make a pact betwixt friends.  They would see to it that Denver would receive the fruits of Meantimes brewing labors, and in exchange Flying Dog would ship a few bottles of local microbrewery beer to the U.K.  With this history lesson in mind, really, I can think of nothing more appropriate to drink on the 4th of July.  Once together (in a way that master and servant are bonded), the U.S. and Britain are now clearly separate and enjoying the fruits of each others labor.  Brits enjoy U.S. exports like beef, steel and uh flippancy in international affairs.  And the British still wont step sending us haughty literature.  There could be no closer bond.  And we can all see who the clear winner is in this Trans-Atlantic trade.  When America rallied and called for Independence we inherited a vast (though claimed) territory rich with resources and rife with ethnic tensions in the making.  And what did the British get?  Humiliation.  And thats exactly how I think it goes down when some poor sot trots down to his local London liquor market and sees the crudely scrawled label of Flying Dog and buys it on a whim.  Meanwhile Im sitting on my porch enjoying the finest Porter Ive ever had, saluting the overhead fireworks and mumbling a patriotic hymn or two.  Its dark and ominous color, like charred, rare meat smugly sits below a cushion of a beach sand colored head.  This admirably comfortable looking beer belches out a flourishing and distinguishing blend of smells including yeast, cinnamon, heavy cream, hops, apple, pears and even asparagus.  Its taste skirts relaxedly across the tongue with its rich, meaty feel and the burdensome but savory smoky, soy, raisin and peat flavors.  The taste is consistent and smooth, guaranteeing a good seven seconds of unbridled elation, made all the better knowing some totally undeserving British academic is choking down In Heat Wheat somewhere on Holloway road.  Its an awful trade, I think, but the WTO hasnt seen fit to strike it down.  Britain hasnt even filed a complaint!  So, let this informal business practice between the good friends at Meantime and Flying Dog persist well into the future.  The fruits of their friendship are being well reaped here, and if Meantime continues to produce beers of the same caliber as the Porter than I have a lot to look forward to in the next decade of American-Anglo relations.",1152316800

This is the 'best smelling' beer I've ever experienced. The appearance is very unassuming, medium golden with a small head that doesn't last for very long.  But what it lacks in appearance, this beer makes up for in taste!  The first bite of those hops is like getting your tongue zapped with a tazer.  And then there's a long, pleasant (bitter) aftertaste similar to what I experience after eating a good grapefruit.  I really like this brew.",1035072000
8,86214,663,Tyranena BGW Devil Over A Barrel,Imperial/Strong Porter,3/5,9/10,15/20,4/5,dmac,8/10,"12 oz bottle from tytoanderso, thanks Tyler. Pours a deep dark brown, amost black, with a smaller foamy mocha head. Aroma originally reminded me of my number one beer, DDC Peche Mortel. Starts off all coffee, loads of and loads of espresso and dark roasted coffee, upon warming some sweet chocolate liqueur and perhaps a slight hint of vanilla and bourbon. Body on this one is only medium with a rather aggresive carbonation for a barrel aged Impy Porter and a good dose of alcohol heat possibly from the barrel aging.  Flavor once again is dominated by loads of coffee, bitter bakers chocolate, and a slight touch of dark fruits (figs and prunes) lending towards the sweetness. The initial aroma is simply fantastic on this one and although this is one very solid beer it took a slight downhill turn from there for me. Ok maybe not downhill but how about it just didnt live up to the aroma.",1224115200

Pours a dark brown brew that allows some light in the pour and sits black in the glass. Produces a one finger brown head. The nose isnt as upfront as I would have liked.

-,98194,663,Tyranena BGW Benjis Chipotle Smoked Imperial Porter,Imperial/Strong Porter,4/5,7/10,15/20,3/5,Beerlando,7/10,"Bottle.  Pouring an extremely dark cola to mahogany color, the body is crowned by a small and smooth, dark tan head.  Lasting a good while, the foam layer gives a solid, spiked sheet of tissue-thin lacing all around the glass.  The aroma is based in dark, bittersweet chocolate roast, with a healthy serving of toasted caramel and some thin coffee.  Theres some earthen hop character, and a bit of smokiness and faint touch of capsaicin from the chipotle.  Flavors show a little creaminess, which softens the chocolate component into more of a dark and milky blend.  The peppery heat is soft, complimented well by citrusy hops and a hint of earthy, dry grass.  Roasted grain lends a burnt, slightly smoky feel, which magnifies the ashy, dry, lively carbonation on the moderately substantive palate.  It seems a little too watery, and the coffee element ultimately doesnt hit a homerun when paired with the peppers.  While its a good, and certainly very interesting brew, it just doesnt come all the way together for me.",1276646400

I was very dissapointed.  I thought this beer would really get better with age.  Another outstanding beer from Allagash.  Rapidly becoming one of my fav brewers. Ive been holding onto a bunch of these for months.  I just couldnt bring my self to open open (if I drink one Ill only have 5 left).  Finally broke down and drank one for Thanksgiving Eve; had to rationalize it).  Anyway, aroma was great.  Even though there are four malts in this, I really didnt notice it or the hops.  What I really noticed was the cherry and ruby port.  Head was creamy, light-brown, excellent lacing, that mostly diminished.  Color was dark amber. Heavy sweet initial flavor that lessens.  Definitely can taste the malt now.  Finish was very long.  The body was not as full as some quads.  Texture was syrupy and flat with incredibly little if any alcohol finish.  One of my favorite quads.  It was very smooth without too much cherry, like Three Phils.  Very interested to see how this matures.  Now only if Allagash would distribute to Georgia.",1132876800

The aroma was somewhat enticing with lots of yeasty esters, dark Belgian malts, spicy apple cider characteristics/cinnamon, prunes, oak, and light ethanol. The body has extremely sharp carbonation and evident alcohol burn. These types of brews are frusturating because often times they offer something decent under the assertive alcohol burn and excessive carbonation. A bit astringent and sweet. It does have light fruity notes of figs, applewood, and the later flavors show some raisins and an alcoholic finish. This Ale doesnt develop anything with warmth or followng sips. I was hoping it would, but there might be something nice under all the astringencies.

Dark, bitter chocolatey taste with undertones of sort of a cherry-like fruitiness that struck me as coming from the yeast.

ABV very well-integrated. This beer really grew on me more as I savored it/let it warm, and was good with food esp. for the style. This definitely has it over the Allagash Black as far as a stout.

T-Upfront is a good dose of floral hop flavor, with a hint of cirtus and fruity sweetness-no funk in the background. Finish is fairly dry as the floral hop bitterness kicks in. What is left to linger is mild floral hop bitterness, a hint of peppery spice...and is that vienna or pilsner malt (WTF?)...somewhat misplaced there.

Just unnecessary, and all it needs is the amarillo hop notes, without all the simcoe bitterness.  Chocolate and biscuit malts sort of scratch at the nose, though some stickiness and base malt sugars do keep it fairly substantial.  Gets rather peachy-bready on the finish, and conjures up memories of Avery 14....But if you focus on the chocolate and caramel notes and the interesting fruitiness up front, its passable.  No flaws, light alcohol warmth, medium to medium-high strength of aroma.Sweet and sticky, with gooey caramel sticking all over the palate.  Flakes of dry chocolate are added to this and lush, tropical fruits emanate from the hops, growing juicier, to the point of fatigue, on the finsh.  Bitterness is never a problem, but it just seems too peachy-sweet and gooey, for lack of a more elegant description.  Roast courses through, but combines with a minty hoppiness that just dosent work, in my opinion, showing too much stark, dry contrast to the sweet caramel.  Phenolic as well (black pepper).

I get notes of apricot, tangerine, ruby red grapefruit, tangelos.  The aroma is really quite interesting, and before my first sip of this beer, I am going to hazard a guess that this is the best part of this beer.  The beer itself is a brilliant deep amber color that is topped by a creamy tan head.		The taste is definitely not quite as intense as the aroma.  It is full bodied, with a certain creamy fullness to it.  The taste is definitely hoppified, with a nice mixture of apricot, grapefruit, and an astringent herbal character.  This beer is not overly bitter, in fact the bitterness is pretty well in balance, there is a lingering astringency that sticks to my tongue long after the beer has slid down my throat, this seems to be from the copious amounts of hops added.  I am sure this will fade with time, but so will the fresh hoppiness that I am enjoying right now.		There are some notes of hot alcohol in the finish as well, but nothing overwhelming.  This is not nearly as malt dominated as I remember last years being.  Basically this beer is quite tasty, and quite a bit better than I have previously given credit for.	2003 Vintage, Sampled November 2003:	A brown head, that as you pour starts deceptively small and then blossoms in my tulip Duvel glass to about 3 inches (7.62 cm for the non-Americans) thick.    A hazy amber color with beautiful garnet notes when held up to the light.  A malty hoppy aroma, evokes the thought of a sticky sweet hop smell.  Surprisingly, very malty was my first thought upon tasting this beer.  The hops are there, but not over the top and in your face.  This is a thick bodied beer that seems to leave a coating film even after I have swallowed.  Definitely hoppy, the more I sip the more I can detect the bitter finish in this beer.  A syrupy hop flavor hits your tongue at first, and then finishes with a drying bitterness. Rating 3.3/6/3/7/4/14",1068681600

The aroma is floral with hops, complemented with some grass and some honey. The mix of grassy, flowery hops and malts makes for a very seductive smell. The flavor follows the aroma: a firm hop bitterness made from flowery, fruity, and spicy hops. There is a touch of citrus and grass, too. The hops are well-balanced by sweet malts that provide flavors of honey and sweet, very light crystal malts. The finish is dry with a sweet but hoppy aftertaste.

Flavors too are shockingly sweet, again loaded with dark sugars, caramel, toffee, and vanilla.  The bourbon comes off overly aggressive and warm, and theres very little in terms of roast to round things out.  The candied nuttiness is a nice touch, but it ultimately only serves to increase the sweetness, not round it out.  Nearly flat, the palate is dense, warm, and overly cloying for my liking.

7,46463,94,Hair of the Dog Blue Dot Double IPA,Imperial/Double IPA,3/5,7/10,12/20,3/5,TAR,6/10,"Hazy apricot. Thin creamy wisp of head. Surprisingly tame herbal and citric hop aroma with hints of honey, baked apples, and spruce. Loose and prickly carbonation. Poorly conditioned. Hop character is initially mushy and vaguely defined, with a raw and oily pungency. Juicy orange explosion briefly quells the peppery aspects and gives way to a tight coniferous assortment. Somewhat airy, with the faintest note of lightly toasted malt sweetness which underscores the honey-drizzled apricot sweetness. Not a lot of bitterness, unfortunately, and the lack of vibrant hop flavors or lasting succulence fails to compensate. As the flavors progress, the hops become overly brash, peppery, and acidic, which further weakens the body. Despite the bottle being settled for more than two days, its still rather yeasty and, to make matters worse, slightly phenolic. Finishes leafy with a soft, rounded edge of bitterness coupled with a peach-fuzz dryness. Somewhat redeems itself with a flavorsome burst of pine and citrus hop burps, but the phenols, while subtle, manage to resurface and taint any brightness that might remain. Somethings undoubtedly amiss here: Unlike all other HotD beers, where a gentle pour raises a sustained mound of meringue, vigorously pouring this generates but a thin wisp.

Was a decent pour, nice amber orange and small off white head.  The dry sweet citrus notes seemed acidic although combined with the earthen hops and rye malt keeps the ABV in check.

Aroma is very cakelike at first, but after the first few sniffs, I can pick up plenty of other things.  Theres plenty of citrus, mainly oranges, some molasses and brown sugar, a light pine, wood, pepper, all held together by this sweet doughy element.  Tastes almost like a Belgian interpretation of an American barley wine, if one can imagine that.  Caramel, wood, brown sugar, and a dry bitter hop flavor combine with a real strong yeast presence.  Though the beer has a sweet malt flavor, I think the aroma is sweeter.  The taste is less cakelike and more woody/earthy.  Some raisins become more apparant now.  The finish has a light grapefruit flavor, along with some backseat sweetness.  The hops shine here, covering the bases of pine, citrus, charcoal, and wood in a balanced fashion.  Bitter and very dry, but not too bitter. Beer feels thick, but drinkable enough, and bit too carbonated for me.

I find a touch of berries in the aroma along with mild, sweaty yeast, broth, a dab of shoe polish and some dry hops (not to be misunderstood as ""dry hopping"" in its traditional sense, but more as in how dried oregano loses some of its potency and character). I find it interesting that the hop flavor I encounter is not like the citric nor piney PNWs Im accustomed to in American IPAs, but rather bitter and herbal as in a German Pilsener. Soft in the mouth, this bitterness proves gentle yet solid and finishes with a twist... those berries I found in the aroma return for a final touch of fruitiness.

Some hops and a very light tea in the aroma, but also a fair amount of stinky feet.  The flavor is more hoppy than the aroma indicates, it being somewhat citrusy and piney, and in balance with the malt initally, but then the finish is dominated by the citrusy hops.  So to me, this is more a traditional, hoppy Pacific Northwest IPA.  Medium bodied, fairly clean, with a crisp finish.  The hazy and bright golden-amber body is topped by a bubbly and small off-white head that settles to a film, but is easily stirred to life with a quick swirl.

Basically, Im rating it here as something you would drink with food, not as a quaffer. Its a clear rose gold, still, and showing good legs. I didnt get a whiff of sulphur dioxide, which I hope means they have sorted out any issues there. Instead, this was as rich and oaky as an aged semillon. Like apples soaked in port perhaps, with a dab of marmalade. Its quite thick on the tongue, verging on sticky. And damn, its sweet, like a late-picked riesling.

Invigorating yet curiously one-dimensional nose of plasticlike phenolics and yeast (plaster, wet paint, Elmers glue). Highly ""airy."" Expressive black pepper and robust sulfur beneath it all, along with saltine cracker, lightly scorched wood, applesauce, and sharp but dull earthy herbal qualities. Snug, boisterous carbonation. Stark and brash, initially, with an overpowering phenolic surge. Drying flourish of sage ensues, intensifying the brisker edges. Fuzzily defined punch of hops deposits a chalky residue on the tongue, though intriguing hints of orange pineapple marmalade exude late. Underlying slickness and a chamomile-esque / Red Delicious apple peel tartness greatly overshadow much of the luste buried deeply within. Not especially polished or refined on the ester front either; whats here is mostly dull and akin to mashed overripe bananas which does little to compensate for the limp body and obscurely defined malt. Alcohol generates noticeable gullet warmth. Finishes with a delicate rounded tartness intertwined with sulfur, Red Delicious apple, husky malt, and waning glimpses of banana bread and pepper-dusted melon. I prefer saison to be exceptionally clean and focused, which this doesnt quite accomplish.  Ultimately, this comes off as muddled and somewhat flawed (sulfur, overt alcohol, slickness of body, overripe banana, fuzzy malt, etc.) rendition. I always complain about our beloved Saison Dupont costing $9 per 750 mL bottle, but the $12 price tag here is laughable if not downright disheartening, even if this happened to be THE benchmark example of saison.

Bittering is on the underbelly and if I waited around for any other amped malt contributions, Id die of old age.  An unseen rebel nemesis keeps the flavor at bay.  Unsalted pretzels shoved in the broiler meet a burnt, sugar-free Oreo pie crust.  Syrupy, sliding melodrama.  Chocolate torte-like in the sense of imparting an arid feeling after each sip.

If you like cinnamon, youll love the Samson stout.  Almost as bewildering, the cinnamon completely disappears in the flavor.  In its stead is lots of coffee and cream, a modicum of fig, a nice weight, and an overarching bitterness.  Its standard fare, as stouts go.

The head on this beer diminishes somewhat quickly, leaving you thinking its just going to die away, but then recedes to a small ring that leaves a fair amount of wispy head on top of the beer.  Aroma is a faint light honey scent, followed by some waxy citrus, herbal, and lemony hops, cookie dough, bread, sweaty malt, and a hint of vegitables (I think this may be due to the combination of malt and hops rather than quality control).  Taste is initally sweaty/bready light malt, very much like a pilsner, then the citrus, lemon, and plant-like hop flavors shine through - though theyre much more subtle than an IPA, they hit at about the same time as the carbonation so you almost perceive the beer as very bitter.  Theres a touch of honey, biscuit, and stale malt too....and theres that hint of vegitables again (faint) or maybe its yeast + stale hops...its difficult to tell what exactly, but its not what I want in my beer.

The bananas are fresher and riper than the esthery variety I find in yeast induced beers.  I thought the body became a bit slick on the tongue, although that could have been the thoughts of 220 lbs. of mushy bananas in the back of my mind.  Like most of Shorts beers, this is a new concept for me and probably the first time I have tasted actual bananas in beer.

Thick and cloying maple only serves to enhance the barbeque sauce quality which seems to stick in the back of my throat.

Auburn amber body and not quite bright (odd!?). A few disagreeably big bubbles cling to the base of the pint, otherwise its sparsely carbonated. A creamy but flaccid off white pad forms atop and manages to stick around for the length. Not much legs remain. Mildly sherryish, sulphury and toffee fueled nose with licks of fresh baked bread coming through. Sweet on first sip with a rough, weedy bitter bite in back. A little tannic rust makes an unpleasant appearance and what seems like watered down red grape juice. Toffee and powdery, smoky black malt a highlight but even this fades under a watery, thin palate. Very weedy aftertaste lingers too long. More hop than malt but not working in its favour. A bit all over the show to be pleasing at all. (50cL, 31/07/09, The Beer Store Morley)",1291766400

A dark, mahogany colored body is almost black in hue, crowned by a tall, spongy head of light brown foam.  Dense, solid rings of lacing circle the glass, coating it well.  The nose is significantly more fruity than expected, notes of earthy fig and dark raisin intertwined amongst burnt caramel malt and notes of sweet dark chocolate.  Woody oak lends that signature Kentucky sour mash twang, imparting loads of vanilla into the fold.  Flavors follow suit, largely dark chocolate based, again loaded with fig and various other dark fruits.  Caramel and toffee bring further sweetness, while the vanilla laden bourbon plays a complimentary backup role.

11.8,104834,241,Weyerbacher Fourteen,Barley Wine,4/5,6/10,13/20,3/5,Chad9976,6/10,"Wheat beers like hefeweizens and witbiers tend to be some of my more favorite types of beers given their great taste, drinkability and the fact theyre quite refreshing. However, I tend to associate those beers with the warmer seasons and with a light body. Then along comes a beer like Weyerbacher Fourteen which defies all presuppositions of what a wheat beer can and should be. This is an overtly big brew in many ways. The brewery dubs it a wheat wine which is similar to a barley wine, but with emphasis on the wheat malts. Its got a lot of character, which is good, but its potency steals the spotlight from the taste. Its enjoyable, but it probably couldve been even better if it wasnt arbitrarily weighty.APPEARANCE AND AROMAJust by appearance alone, Weyerbacher Fourteen might be a familiar beer to fans of hefeweizens and India Pale Ales. Its a very hazy shade of dark orange and rusty copper. It doesnt produce much of a head  just a white, soapy-like coating at the top of the beer.The aroma is very strong with a dry, rubbing alcohol-like scent. Upon closer inspection I can detect traces of spices, which is sweet and inviting  but fairly weak nevertheless.TASTEI like and appreciate beers with complex palates, but when alcohol is a major component to a beers taste its difficult to appreciate. Weyerbacher Fourteen starts out very reminiscent of an authentic German-style wheat beer with a rich palate of spiciness and sweetness. I get a tasty combination of what tastes like coriander, orange peel, banana and clove, but its all overshadowed by a dry alcoholic presence.These spices, while fairly mild, do add up to form a pretty tasty palate. Its just too bad the alcohol keeps getting in the way. Whats funny is the order in which the flavors come to me: alcohol, spice, sweetness, and then MORE alcohol. So while its easy to characterize Weyerbacher Fourteen as a boozy beer, it should be noted that it does indeed taste good. Aside from the spices theres something of a fruitiness to this palate (figs and plum) which is satisfying and actually quite refreshing (as refreshing as a beer this big can be, that is). DRINKABILITYFor a big with such an obviously-huge body, Weyerbacher Fourteen isnt quite as challenging to drink as one might assume. While alcohol does play a significant role in the palate, the beer is still quite smooth. The mouthfeel is thick, heavy and almost chewy, but the spice doesnt tear up my tongue. There is a noticeable warming effect on the finish, but since this beer is 11.8% ABV thats to be expected. I didnt care much for the dry aftertaste, though. Its rather sharp and reminds me of the taste of a thermometer left sitting in a jar of rubbing alcohol. Not surprisingly the beer left me with a noticeable buzz, but its nothing I couldnt handle (I would recommend drinking this on a full stomach, though). FINAL THOUGHTSSometimes I think its almost unfair to judge a beer as big as this too early, since its meant to be aged. Id be interested to see how the sharp edge of the booze might dull after a year or two. At $3 per bottle, Weyerbacher Fourteen is a fairly low risk for those looking to drink an imperial beer which is vastly different from other big beers, or those interested in what an imperial wheat wine is really like.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5Akwokgy94",1272585600

Coming in a goblet this is probably one of the best pumpkin beers that I have had.  Weyerbacher is slowly getting back in my good graces; as I clear out the cellar I may have to try some of their imperial stouts and other releases.  They certainly are not hard to find around this area.				<b>Aroma / Appearance</b> - The deep maroon body was as dark as I have seen in this style.  Sticky lacing and a minimal head gave it great character.  The smell of cooked pumpkin, brown sugar, spice, and caramel made it over the top and in the face.  Some people may find that a flaw; I thought it made it stand out in sea of blandness.				<b>Flavor / Palate</b> - Thick and creamy this definitely earns the imperial label.  Carbonated until the end the smooth bitterness holds together a rich experience.  Well balanced with a blend of spices, ginger, brown sugar, and pumpkin filling made it worth every sip.

A bit of age on it, I believe about 5 months, however, it has been kept in an extremely cold fridge the entire time.With opening (while still quite cold), it proves to be a gusher.  Haha, not good.A glassy, very clear peach-bronze body sports a white head that is initially bolstered by the increased amount of infection-driven carbonation.  But as soon as a majority of the carbonation fizzles, the head quickly fades to cover/ring, leaving no lacing.Aroma confirms there is something wrong.  Sourish notes and wet socks are quite apparent, dominating the biscuity grains that lie behind.  Not a rancid or horrible infection, and actually the more it breathes, it actually seems to lessen significantly.  You can at least still get a sense of the beer behind it.  Light fruity and mildly hopped, dry, with no real flaws.  Really nice fresh grainy, almost biscuity malt character.  Medium strength to the aroma, with no alcohol apparent.The flavor is impacted quite severely by the infection as well.  Spoiled milk is lightly noted, along with a sourish corn-like flavor.  Again, however, it seems to disappear, and quite quickly, with breathing (though not completely).  I ended up actually taking a few more mouthfulls and enjoying the pale, grainy, only marginally sweet maltiness.  No adjunct flavor or major flaws.  Some light fruitiness (peaches, apples) at most, no doubt just from the ale yeast.  Even a mild, saaz-like hoppiness that is subtle but still nicely done.  Fizzy, forced carbonation could use some work, as it gives a little wateriness to the texture, but overall, it seems this is quite a well-brewed beer....if it werent for the infection.

Initial is less acidic than the nose lets on, a good bite of sour red fruit, lactic acid, touches of bread, toast, faint toffee. Touches of brett, wet oak and red wine tannins mix in. Acidic red wine vinegar seizes the day on the finish with some good acidity, sweet toasty and bready, biscuity malts. Red wine tannins, red fruit. The acidity isnt as bad as I was expecting, but it is still the prominent factor in the beer. Better than oaked Sea Bass. And near the complete opposite spectrum. We did a blend of both beers that seemed muchhh better than either. The acidity grabs me as it preaches a good sourness and vinegar quality, but at times it is a bit much, with dry red wine tannins providing synergy of the flavor, and not always in a good way.

Pours a very dark deep brown, chocolatey with a touch of red, opaque murky, a bit of light with a moderate brownish lighter head. Nice. Aromas are a nice blend of caramel and toffee, biscuits and some light peaty malt coupled with some light Bourbon notes, vanilla, chocolate, sweeter edge on the nose is, frankly, lovely, with the wet oak and peat coming through more noticeably, chocolate chip cookies and caramel toasty malts, this beer is well barrel aged it seems, as alcohol doesnt seem there. Initial is a nice strong brew up front, cocoa, tobacco, caramel, toffee, vanilla, wet oak grows on the tounge, a light booziness is there, but not necessarily all spirit (Bourbon). Chocolate chip cookies, creamy toffee and nougat, a touch of roasty coffee and pretty strong tobacco. The tingling alcohol does grow, a warm rolling heat of the booze is pleasant, doesnt take away from the lovely beer. I must say, the base wasnt one of my favorite CCB beers.. But it certainly is a great candidate for barrel aging. Finish is sweet, bourbon and malts, smooth with a light lingering heat, faint bitterness. Tobacco, cocoa, coffee, toffee, and caramel stick to the palate, really coat. A winner. Glad I have another.",1263254400

Pours with an overcarbonated head which makes me a bit leary (oh damn, did I get a bad one?).  All my patience is eventually shown an unusual mix of aromas.  Unpleasant cidery aromas mixed with light golding hops and strong pinot noir presence.  Dont quite know what to make of this even having read what I should expect.  Nice ruby look to the beer, but the first sip leaves me confused.  Typical old-world Belgian strong, but with accents of slight acidity and tannins most likely from the wood aging.  High carbonation, a bit too much so, but on par with the style.   Soon after, a slightly sour character mixed with red wine and just a hint of the specialty malts used.  However, the red wine flavour overpowers all and leaves this ale unbalanced and flawed in my opinion.  My overall impression is that the bottle I had was mostly to the brewers intent.  However, as the recipe is concerned could be better formulated by toning down on the strong wine character and allowing the delicate nature of the malts and hops do most of the talking.

The alcohol level has been boosted significantly, and the beer has become much drier and more complex. Gone is the cloying sweetness from the past, and drinkability is through the roof, limited only by availability and your wallet.		Pours dark gold, hazy, with fine particulates in suspension.	Significant sediment left behind in the bottle as well.	Off-white, tight head rises modestly upon a carefull, angled pour.	Head retention is minimal with all but edging and a center whisp remaining after 2 minutes.	Color is noticably lighter than the standard Stille Nacht, hinting at a more attenuated density.	Nose is Flandersesque, with residaul sweetness, but not overwhelming in either aspect.	Honey and some mild mulled apple notes work well with a highly phenolic profile.	Aromatics finish warming with light spice notes, coriander, orange blossoms, and dried cherries.	On the thick side of medium bodied, slightly syrupy and quite sticky. Carbonation is lightish, but enough to add some crispness.	Pallet is hugely Belgian, loads of fruit candy-like essense and honey. Alcohol is significant but not hot. Bitterness is right on, smooth and balancing.	A myriad of fruit mingles with juicy malt and rum-soaked bubblegum.	Pallet finishes long and warming on the back of the toungue, with none of the cloying residuals of the previous Stille Nachts.	A stronger, drier, more complex and drinkable version.	Extensive aging should be a real treat.		4/24/08 cellar check of ""Specbrew2005""		The carbonation seems a bit subdued, with a one-inch head at best with a long pour. 	Candied green apples making a stronger presence as this one ages.	The mouthfeel could use some carbonation to keep things lively.	Slightly dryer yet on the pallet, but still a fair amount of juicy malt and esters.	Alcohol is under the radar, and the beer drinks fast.",1204675200

How: Bottle 330ml, forgotten in my fridge by Dickinsonbeer.  Thanks a lot Paul!!!  Probably 1+ year old.	The look: Cloudy dark golden body with lots of big ugly yeast chunks topped by a white ring of foam	In long: Honey and cereals on the nose.   Taste is more of the same.  Lots of alcohol, some apples concentrate, lots of honey, more alcohol, a drop of hard cider, lack of hops, too much candy sugar, even more alcohol.  Im a huge fan of some of the De Dolle beers (arabier and oerbier and top-50 of mine) but I really dont care from some of their stronger offerings and the regular Dulle Teve is one Ive never liked.  If anything this Special Reserva is even more brutal and more alcohol-intense than the regular Dulle Teve.  The barrel aging didnt translate into barrel/woody taste but if this beer had any subtle flavours (barrel or others) they were all crushed by the alcohol.  I had only a single 330ml bottle and I was really bored by it.  I almost drained poured 1/3 of the bottle.   Fortunately the second half of the bottles had yeast chunks that provided some fruity distractions (peaches, mangos) from the alcohol.

There is a sweet yeast flavor tied in with the hop flavor isnt what I thought it would be. At first the beer is really sweet then the bittering hop is decent. The flavor is just weird. Not as good as it looks or smells. I am disappointed with the flavor. Overall, the side projects have been a let down, but I was pleased to try this one.",1237334400

Smell: Predominately, its a nose of roasted malts soaked in gourmet coffee and bittersweet chocolate bits. Particularly mild, mingled notes of the Tennessee whiskey. Slight hint of oxidative wafts. Vague, indistinct fruitiness, though this certainly grows at it warms a touch.		Taste: Dark, roasty malts express fully sweet flavors of chocolate, chilled coffee, and dark caramel. As with the nose, the whiskey tastes are fairly light, yielding soft hints of vanilla and oaken barrels. Still, theres some light hints of age and oxidation to the malts, which just leaves me thoughtfully wondering how old this keg is exactly. Well-restrained roasted malt bitterness. Finishes sweet and fruity with a few drops of fine sherry.		Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium-low carbonation. Smooth, oat-laced mouthfeel.		Drinkability: This one goes down tremendously easy.

When poured it looked dark brown to black with a body that appeared opaque at first glance, but revealed ruby highlights when held up against strong light.  The beer came out sounding fizzy like a soft drink, and the head was foamy and one inch thick immediately after pouring.  It died down to a more modest crown of bubbles shortly afterwards, and ended up as a thin ring by the time the glass was mostly consumed.  Not much lacing to speak of either.		The aroma was very pleasing, with chocolate, caramel, dark fruits, and hops is a sweet harmony.  The taste was similar, but with dark fruits playing the lead role, followed closely by the caramel.  Lactic sourness was a good counterbalance to the sweet malts.  Not many burnt or roasty flavors to speak of, except a little bit of burnt toast like astringent bitterness.  Alcohol was quite warm and soothing.		The beer was very easy to drink despite the multitude of flavors.

Resoundingly satisfying, will do quite nicely when the temperature rises and the warm breezes blow.	Foes of fruity brews should stay far away, however. 	I am not one of those.	Hoorah!",1115164800

Its pitch black and sticks to the glass, but bounces off the palate like an Eagles player trying to tackle a Chicago Bear right now. The beer has a sweet finish thats not cloying, but the coconut does linger. A beer like this would pair well with food, and indeed it went great with the Indian food I had earlier. That said, the brew is so well-crafted and the head is such a deep tan that looking and feeling this beer is just as important as what it pairs with. Especially because right now, I wish this medium to full bodied coconut cake would pair with an Eagles win. Final words? Too sweet, too coconut, but if thats your thing, this beer is amazing. It reminds me of the milk stout version of MTHs Macaroon, and even if its too sweet, everyone needs a little cake once in a while.		But its not looking likely.

Large cap of speckled tan foam sits for good length before finally settling to a firm skim and lacing sticking in minimal blobs and strings.		Aroma is roasted grains and chocolate with a slight smokey bonfire cedar chip hint.		Flavors are mild to start with smooth and adequately easy roasted grains and malts. Small bits of chocolate make its way in around the edges. Finish totally makes this all the while with a fantastic little realm of smokey cedar over light molasses and roasted grain coming across with a very subtle growth of charcoal and smoldering wood and grasses. Very nice on the finish with this particular porter. Nothing like the Sparnfarkel from beers past that was more tangy and sweetness sitting in the back. This stays steady with a light roast and a chocolate coating that eases right down. Then that fun little finish slides in and takes a wonderful turn of smoked wood treats. This pint was gone in no time flat as it goes down very well. Keeping a medium to light carbonation and body to its character.

Mostly clear, little to no lacing.  Aroma is lightly grassy, with some strong herbal hop notes (oregano, cumin, basil) and a light touch of lemons and white cookie dough.  Moderate strength, mostly hoppy, with a slightly vegetal (not-DMS) element, of plant stalks, leaves, wet grass.  Dry butter conceals itself beneath the vegetal and herbal qualities, but is immediately noticeable in the flavor.  Quite buttery it begins, passing to a light pale malt sugariness and finally some dry floral notes, almost soapy, with more dry leaves, light herbs and hints of lemon and orange rind here and there.  The diacetyl does not overpower, by any means, though it could stand to be a little less apparent, as the hops do not succeed in clearing the palate, being only lightly flavorful and very minimally bitter.

Hey, this is confusing; wouldnt a beer called hoppus maximus that contains the most hops be an IPA at least?  I havent had this before because I thought it was an IPA from the name.  Once poured this has a big bubbles head.  Darker yellow color, slightly darker than the ubiquitous american pale ale.  This is just a little hazy, but it does have the appearance of an IPA.  Barely any aroma at all but what I do smell is hops. Head fades to a froth. The first taste is IPA all the way.  Amber ale?  Too hoppy for an amber ale.  A little too much medicine bitter quality for for my girlie taste buds.  I have tasted many IPAs that were less hoppy than this.

Pours a pitch black color with a large collapsing head and spider web-like lacing. The aroma is rich with strong coffee, burnt molasses, and chocolate. The taste is complimented by the aroma and is fairly complex. Nutty with a ton of dark, bitter chocolate and roasted grains. Caramel and molasses bring about a balancing sweetness. There is also a nice milky quality that creeps through. Deep layers with hints of dark cherries and some port wine. Finishes strong and smooth which I like in a stout.

Though there is a touch of banana evident, it is mostly the soft, creamy sweet malt, and lightly floral hops that give aroma.  Flavor is light citrus, hints of soft bubblegum, light doughy malt and a zesty spiciness from the hops.  Ends with some peppery, perhaps clove-like spice, quite crisp and refreshing.  It dosent end watery and thick like some recent examples I have had.  I think crispness is important in a summer beer.  Moderate carbonation is natural and unobtrusive, while the body is a solid medium, with no wateriness.  Low yeast apparency and only marginal wheat flavors, no sourness really.  Still, I enjoyed the malt and soft hops.",1118793600

I am thankful Ive been provided the opportunity to try this before it fades into retired obscurity. Id like to note that while I noticed many subtle nuances in this beer, it seemed muted in almost every aspect, but would prove to be a lovely McKenzie offering nonetheless. Due to the brewer Scotts recent termination, knowing that this would be the last batch ever made for some anticipation of the highest order. My last good quality McKenzie brew ever? On to the show. Pours a ruddy amber with highlights that remind me of the muddy bog Atreyus horse succumbs to in The Neverending Story. A cloudy beer with a light beige head. the syrupy consistency leaves little lacing, sucking the webs of froth back into the murky depths. The aroma is of heavy wheat malt, earthy hops, cinnamon, nutmeg, grassiness and light yeast. Hmmm. More like an ultra-complex Weizenbock. Flavor is more playful, bringing in more of the aromas hints, but also notes of full wheat malts, caramel, pepper, must, coriander, the slightest hint of cardamom, brown sugar, tea with lemon, mushrooms and finally some cocoa dust. The finish is very sweet up front. Near the end, at warmer temperatures, a big hop dose leads to a medium-dry, somewhat long climax. Seems as similar to weizenbock as true saison in both aroma and flavor. In the warmer temperatures, this libation seems earthier, funkier, sweeter in aroma, with big banana and vanilla wafers sliding into the fray near room temp.

Mouthfeel is pretty sturdy with nice moderate fizzy carbonation.  Its a little oily on the finish, causing it to linger on for a good long time.  Overall, this was pretty darn far out from the average American Dark Lager.  I think that Im partially a sucker for this one because of the smoke flavor.  Me like.",1200441600

The beer is a pale-amber / light gold color that shows a hazy, straw gold color when held up to the light.  The beer smells quite herbal, with a fair amount of earthy spiciness and lots of dried hay / grass aromatics.  I am not sure if spices were added to this, but there is a definite spicy presence to this beer, it definitely reminds me of coriander, perhaps a touch of white pepper and some woody ginger and lemon notes.  There is a backdrop of more fruity, hop-like, citrus notes towards the end, though this almost plays a secondary role to the up front, though still subtle spiciness.  There is a certain mustiness to the aroma here and it mixes with a dry, pale cracker like grain character.		There is a huge up front hop character that comes through quite a bit more clearly than it did in the aroma.  There is a big, though dry, citrus zest character that has notes of Meyer Lemon, tart grapefruit zest, touches of tangelo zest and some lychee.  Towards the middle and finish of this beer an earthy and grassy spiciness starts to kick in; it has notes of white pepper, lemon grass (with an emphasis on the grass portion), definite earthy coriander as well as some phenolics in the finish that contribute a slight, sort of plastic like note and perhaps some clove too (now that I have noticed the phenolics).  The combination of hop notes (herbal and bitterness) with the earthy spiciness and the phenolics adds a bit of sharpness to the finish.  The body of this beer is nice and light and quaffable, it has just enough character to not be overly thin though.		I wasnt really aware that this had spices and a Belgian yeast used in the recipe.  I am still not absolutely sure this is true, but it certainly seems like it as there are a whole lot of flavors in this beer that are not at all part of a traditional hop profile.  Not at all what I was expecting, but it is still quite tasty and I am definitely enjoying this beer.  I wouldnt mind if the combination of sharp herbal / yeast / spice character in the finish was tempered quite a bit & I think a juicy hop fruit character (which is what I was expecting before having opened this beer) would really have been nice as well.",1314230400

A strong sensation of red wine tannins and thats where the beer lost its appeal to me.  Far from highly drinkable.  The high average score of this beer can only be due to people sharing bottles.

Somewhat hazy, golden body with hints of orange and a finger of quickly dissipating white head.  Bold aromas of lemony noble hops jump out of the glass right away, along with a subtle musty, cherry-like brett character.  Not really getting much vanilla or distinctive spicy oak characters coming through, so the oak appears to be revealing itself more in the brett presence.  Peaches, pineapple, and hints of honey malt sweetness.  Medium-full bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a rich, malty texture.  The base beer is definitely more mai-bock in nature than doppelbock, although after the dry-hopping and barrel-aging, the malt make-up becomes kind of a moot point.  A mild tartness comes out up front on the palate, followed closely by a pleasant herbal hop bitterness edged with lemon.  Strangely, the malt sweetness comes out on the near the back end, giving it a bit of a doughy, bready sweetness.  Finishes moderately hoppy, with some musky brett left lingering on the palate.  Remarkably dry, although the once presumably-hefty malt presence doesnt appear to be missing texture-wise.  Thanks, Sean!",1238371200

The aroma has notes of wild yeast, acidic fruit, oak, toffee, wheat, herbal hops, slight oxidization but in a good old school way, earthy and even a hint of black olives. The taste is even more impressive with a big WOW factor that nearly left me speechless and perplexed on what to write. There is a wonderful transition between sour and sweet, fruitiness and maltiness, wheat and oak. The complexity just grows and grows with a lovely hint of Scottish and English old ale notes for backup. This takes the joyful interplay that the Pippenbock had and amps it up to 11. I am just floored by this, Steve has knocked these non-traditionally soured beers out of the park. The mouth feel while warming does a good job of hiding the alcohol found within to a dangerous level, rich, oily and yet snappy and strangely refreshing.

I didnt mind the spice flavors, but I wasnt exactly craving them either. I dont think this is very balaced either, mainly because the spices took over everything else.

It is a great example of what home brewers are doing to expand the boundaries of brewing, which is a driving force of Sam Adams.	There is a regret in the Longshot Series and it is that the incredible brews that Sam Adams discovers are only for a short time. This is one of them. As I have evaluated brews, my concern is not how  they match a supposed standard while at the same time realizing that there are specificities for a particular brew but how they impact my palate when drunk (not the condition of inebriation but the act of drinking - although :>)). And the time of impact is imporant - a cookout, a brew tasting, after mowing the lawn. This brew is an example. Is there a standrard for a Lemon Pepper Saison? Imagine what it would look like if there were standards for all the variations. Who would determine what the variations are? Creativity would indeed be stiffled even eliminated.

4.8,158,32,Samuel Adams Boston Lager,Vienna,1/5,8/10,16/20,3/5,Chad9976,7/10,"Im an ale man, so whenever I see the word lager I tend to roll my eyes. This is a type of beer style associated with mass-produced, watered-down brews that give American beer a bad name. Thankfully, Samuel Adams Boston Lager is nothing like Budweiser or any other those other big-name beers. The Boston Beer Company has actually managed to make a lager complex and give it some real bite  amazing!   THE POUR   In my experience, almost every beer in the Sam Adams line pours smoothly and generates a well-proportioned head. The same is true of the Boston Lager, their flagship label. Most critics commend it for its long lasting head, but I find it dissipates rather quickly (although it is quite tasty).   COLOR & AROMA   The Boston Lager is one of the most easily recognizable beers from its color alone. For a lager its quite dark and resembles ale with its dark amber/copper colors and crystal clarity. It looks a lot like the Boston Ale and shares the same aroma as its sister brew, which is almost no scent at all. The initial aroma is indicative of a strong hop foundation but only a real beer snob would be able to detect this. Its scent is rather weak, overall, but whatever lingers is surprisingly pleasant to the nose.   TASTE   You might have seen the commercials where Jim Koch brags about how they use a full pound of hops per barrel whereas other companies use only a handful. They definitely werent lying, as the Boston Lager has a distinctive kick to it. In fact, its so strong its often a turn-off to novice beer drinkers and those who just want something smooth and easy to chug. Those drinkers need to grab something made in St. Louis or Milwaukee, because Sam Adams Boston Lager isnt for them. Some might call it harsh, I call it an awakening of the palette.   BODY   Mr. Koch, are you sure this is a lager? It looks, tastes and drinks like an ale because its in no way a light body. This lager has the weight of a stout or a porter at the least. Its heavy density makes it a bit of a surprise, and not necessarily in a good way. You can easily get filled up after just two bottles or pints of this beer. But at least youll do so through some quality brew, eh?   FINISH   The Boston Lager maintains its taste and complexity from start to finish which is always a good thing. Some say it finishes bitterer than it starts out, but I find this to be only remotely true. It does have a nice bite at the end, which is the only way to a beer with a constant bite throughout could naturally finish. Its definitely a beer you can down quite a few in a row. However, its a high-end brew so doing so could be expensive. I think its best enjoyed in a Sam Adams mix pack or one pint at a time on tap.   FINAL THOUGHTS   It took me years to truly appreciate Samuel Adams Boston Lager for the craft that it is. For the longest time I just found it much too harsh to appreciate, but I eventually came around. I think their commercials describe it perfectly, Dont be afraid of the taste.    How true that is.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xdJv0TD66A",1270339200

The flavor found more molasses than anything else at the core with some vanilla, coffee, and chocolate joining.. liquid smoke and dry, peppery earth were laced throughout.. finished with a sweet uptick of chocolate, molasses, and charred smoke.

While last bottle was a good one, this had done some effort to be undrinkable. It looked nice, a dark brown beer, almost clear, with a small, tan to beige head. Quite oily pour. The aroma was the best part, but for someone disliking oxidation, it wouldnt be nice at all. The beer was roasted, but an oxidized, almost sherry-like aroma dominated. In the mouth it felt more sour than oxidized, but the oxidation was very evident, leaving some roasted flavors in the background. Full-bodied and unfortunately slightly astringent. Yes, its drinkable, but the bottle I tried last time was a completely different story. Too bad. Rating: 6-4-4-3-9-2.8. Leaving my old rating as the valid one. Bottled, 75cl with champagne cork. A clear-looking dark reddish brown beer with a nice tan head. It has lots of chocolate and cocoa in the aroma, as well as roasted malt. Some sourness, roasted malt and some dark chocolate and burnt notes in the flavor. Dusty, dryish mouthfeel, but a bit too watery. The beer starts very good, the aroma can be enjoyed for a long time, but sadly its downwards from there. A quite nice beer anyway. (070213)",1172620800

Pours RAVEN BLACK (it shines) with a two finger tan head.  Take a picture because you wont see a better looking beer anywhere.  Huge aroma of malt chocolate, tons of coffee, and even jalapeno peppers.  Marvelous intense aroma.  Tastes very malty, with tons of chocoff, some fruit, nut hints, and that finishing burst of jalapeno oil which twitches the tongue.  The palate is super firm, very well balanced, and amazingly complex.  As it warmed, more chocolate and even raspberries came out with the coffee receding a bit.  The jalapeno sensation remained throughout, and it was a welcome innovation.  If this beer was Greg Louganis, its head would not have hit the diving board and bled AIDS into the Olympic pool.  No deductions here, even from the Russian judge.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have PERFECTION!  Hands down, the best stout I have ever had along with the Central Waters BBS.

The nose gives strong hints of roasted malt, with a nod especially to what seems to be  a relatively low lovibond chocolate malt.  The palate is distinctly roasted and malty up front, showing dark chocolate notes.  The mid-palate shows a nice west coast hop presence.  It stops short of having the assertive character of an American stout, but is far more than what would be seen in a standard English robust porter.  One thing that could further improve what is a fairly complex palate would be the increased use of mid-range crystal malts.  Overall, not life-changing, but nicely done.",1256601600

Nose of new oak, vanilla and just the slightest notion of hazelnut and caramel, but it is so light, its hardly worth mentioning.  I wish those notes were more vibrant, as it would make the nose so much better.  Also, because of the use of new oak, it does have some contaminated aromas.  I am not saying it is contaminated, but because of the use of new oak, the scents of wildness and funk are easy to notice.  Flavor mainly consists of new oak, vanilla and a slight hint of golden raisin and caramel.  Disappointed in the lack of complexity, poor finesse and fairly muted flavors.

5,66453,2469,North By Northwest Flemish Sour Ale,Sour Ale/Wild Ale,4/5,9/10,18/20,4/5,FlacoAlto,9/10,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2008 I first sampled this at the Bomb Factory Party and then multiple times throughout GABF 2008.  Much to Tys (the brewmaster) chagrin at times, I easily drank more of this over the long weekend than anything else.  The beer has a full gold color to it, is reasonably clear and is topped by a frothy, pale white colored head.  The aroma has a fruity / tart note of grapefruit, lots of lactic character, plus some welcome harder acidic notes that lean toward acetic and help to boost more fruit aromatic notes.  There is a touch of grassy malt towards the finish and there is a soft, lovely, funky, butyric acid stained, musty, musky, barnyard note that lies in the background of the nose and seems to just anchor the whole thing together.		The flavor is just so complex.  The sourness actually coats the palate, but is not in anyway overwhelming (at least for this sour head).  The acidity is definitely complex in character, it is dominated by lactic sourness, but it has such a nice, expressive acetic acidity to it that I really enjoy finding in my sour beers.  There is a lingering, musky, farmhouse cheese note that sort of softly intrudes on the sour parade.  This has quite a bit of fruitiness to it, that is really amplified by the complex sourness; flavors of sour apple, a touch of tart cherry notes and a richly fruity, balsamic type note each add some layered richness to this brew.  Carbonated just enough to keep the beer light and textured, the beer is quite quaffable, but definitely has a light viscousness to it that helps to soften the effect of the acidity just a bit.		This is an incredibly fantastic beer, there was a reason I drank so much of this.  I am really quite jealous that Austin has a brewery doing things like this (I wish a commercial AZ enterprise would start doing beers like this).  I really like the acetic edge that is in this beer; I am finding that I like a more dominant lactic character to be offset by acetic acid notes, as it really boosts the complexity of a brew.",1224288000

Explosive, dense fruity nose complexified by well-extracted woodiness that brings about butterscotch, vanilla and delicious tannins. Overripe or perhaps dried fruits included on the platter include pear, apricot, raisins and figs, at times approaching a tropical nature. When you anticipate the sweetness might become too much, the efficient tartness puts it back on place. Richly complex, multi-layered experimental brew that visits most of the flavour spectrum in the beer world besides hoppy weavings. I personally find it fantastic how you can feel the caramel that must have been a huge part of this beer before it met its barreled faith... you can still feel it, but only its flavours, not its texture and sugariness. Instead, the malty richness matured into a glorious fruitiness and a textured textbook strong sour ale. While considerable warmth creeps up as the conclusion approaches, it is mostly neglected by its strong vinous character and the tannins that come with it. In an oaky, tannic ale, the warmth feels fitting, and we,re never talking about pure alcohol flavour here. Obviously, the oak sojour and tannins acquired mean youre not to expect a thicker than porridge ale, but instead a medium-bodied, slightly carbonated, smooth palate whose sole purpose is to carry the abundant flavours to destination.",1276560000

Espressso beans dominate the flavor as well with a malty sweetness. Flavor actually reminds me a lot of a less alcoholic Kahlua. Very similar to Kahlua, which doesnt bother me since I really like Kahlua. Medium in body with ample carbonation. Not the most drinkable beer in the world, though it wasnt much work to finish the glass. A unique interesting beer unlike any Ive had. Perhaps a more fitting name would be Coffee Stout rather than a chocolate stout, though I understand the name. Glad I tried it, definitely worth a try.

Nonetheless, the nose successfully combines natural aromas of green apples, brown sugar, pepper, and caramel to surprising scents of soap, banana yoghurt, leather and chocolate chip cookies.

It started well - it smells fresh, sweet and honeyed on opening. It pours a deep amber with a small but lasting white head and a pleasant soft carbonation.  The taste is a disappointment though - the overwhelming impression is weak and watery.  You do get a bit of sweetness of the honey coming through, with some dusty hops and maybe a hint of citrus, but you really have to search for them.  A big disappointment, but if Im in the area Ill give another of their beers a go just because I liked the brewers so much and want them to keep going!",1216944000

Perfumey hop aroma paired with less punctual coarse/herbal hops, pepper, moss, and flowers. Slight airiness adds more depth and releases some subtle pale malts. Creamy body yet spritzy enough to maintain its pilsner feel. Brash, herbal hop flavors collide with a slowly-developing sweetness, which is managed by the perfume. Lemon zest blends gorgeously with the staunch hop bitterness while firm pale malt hulls firm up the body. Flurry of mossy noble hop flavors, alcohol, and late-arriving honeyed pale malt undertones outweigh most of the hop bitterness in the finish. Mild mineral, dough, and rounded yeast notes linger to revive the hop flavors.

Last summer I was called back to Colorado Springs to check in on my alma mater, and to take in some of the surrounding joys - Manitou Springs, namely. But any visit to Colorado College requires checking back in with our pipeline of liquid joy, Bristol Brewery. Little had changed from my college years; the same wafts of cooking malts filled the dense air of the tasting room, and the characteristically hirsute brewers tramped around in their work boots, sometimes to mingle with the customers. Colorados canine credentials are always on display here, with dog bowls available for visiting pets and the Laughing Lab logo adorning glasses, growlers and coasters. As usual I opted for something new, and the new beer available that day was a growler of Smokebrush Porter. It made a welcome accompaniment to board games back in Denver. It pours a thin milk chocolate covered head with a deep, dark ruby red body. Plum, raisin and black currants feature strongly in the aroma. A medium body and a mild carbonation deliver the flavor with a light smoothness at first. Mild notes of chocolate, a nice maltiness soon turn into heavier, darker flavors. The aftertaste is slightly heavier, introducing a slight bitterness of teriyaki sauce. Overall, this is a light porter, despite the outdoorsy feeling of the label - its a porter with strong attachment to black currant and berry flavors, and makes for a nice dark beer that stands out when compared to other breweries staple porters. It also reminds me why Bristol Brewery was Colorado Colleges beer supplier of choice.",1322092800

I started out not liking it very much but enjoyed it quite a bit towards the end. Upon opening it was extremely carbonated and slowly gushed for 3 minutes before I decided to pour it.  The flavor, aroma, and texture were quite harsh and not at all pleasant (smelled like a dirty dishrag for one thing).  However once it warmed up and lost some carbonation its character changed and became quite pleasing, almost like a very mild and sweet lambic.  The following then is what I experienced and rated when the beer de-gassed for a bit and warmed up to 60F:  	No head and no lacing at all; nice hazy med-gold color.Aroma was sweet and fruity layered with a hint of bubblegum, a subtle oaky ""brettiness"", and a very present alcohol character. Off-dry, malty start; fruity mid-palate with some oakiness; finish was also off-dry with an assertive bitterness that carried into the aftertaste.  The aftertaste had an interesting dry, husky malt character, akin to having chewed on a few grains of barley malt.  Palate was med-full with a creamy, almost oily texture.

I can get a bit of raisin and hops in the aroma once the beer has warmed a few degress.		The malts are dictating the taste of this one bringing some strong bready notes paired with a very powerful caramel. There is a touch of sweetness with the caramel but the finish is on the bitter side and tastes of pine and hops.		The beer is full bodied with low to moderate carbonation. There is a very nice warming sensation from this beer and as you breath after every sip you get the alcohol sensation down your throat.		Overall this was a very nice beer for the winter weather.

Flavor is neither as sweet nor as sour as the aroma might suggest; while not exactly dry, you get a nice tripel dryness.

For some reason I was expecting a lighter-bodied beer, but this Grand Cru poured deep red-brown and somewhat cloudy with a medium-light off-white (light tan?) head.  Aroma was very potent and interesting- I picked up tangy, rotting fruit (not in a bad sense, of course), bubblegum, and even peat.  Awesome flavor profile- bubblegum and red licorice/strawberry candy flavors pierce the toasty body.  A touch of cinnamon, chocolate, and apple peel join alcohol in the finish.  This reminds me in a sense of Avery The Beast (with much lower ABV).  Its relatively heavy body, rich flavor, and nice blend of sweet and dry notes puts this beer in the upper echelon of Belgian Strongs.

Never much in the way of hops or bitterness. Rebound of basic malty sweetness along with a rather woody quality to the finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation.		Drinkability: Hmm. Well, its certainly interesting, Ill give it at least that much. Maybe its the decaying brain cells, but I cannot adequately recall such a light base beer getting the bourbon barrel treatment. Its appealing to try all the characteristics bourbon barrel aging has to offer without being hampered and diluted by a... well, more substantial beer, but it doesnt make for an overall sublime drinking experience and doesnt have much appeal beyond the one bottle.",1224892800
8.5,92483,6166,Green Man Whisky Bock,Doppelbock,4/5,9/10,18/20,4/5,pickled,8/10,"I tried this at the North Island launch at Rumbles on Friday 29th August.  Tom Jones gave me 3 small samples - not the panty moistening Welshman but an affable Pom from somewhere in the mid west.  The caution on the label is warranted as this really is strong stuff.  It seemed stronger than 9% but manages to be well balanced at the same time.  Some time ago I tried the Strong, and quite liked it, but I noted from the label that it was a blend with the Green Man bitter.  All I could think was ""why water it down?"" Well, question answered.  The Strong is a complex beer with a multitude of flavours.  The Whisky Bock is less complex but wow its good.  This review is based on bottle number 1338 of 1400 (330ml) and was accompanied by a dose of Dr Who on TV.  Even my mother liked this beer and thats saying something.  Its sweet but not too sweet as the yanky oak and hops bring it down to a reasonable level.  Its quite a light colour for a bock beer (really the style is a misnomer as it defies categorisation) and there isnt a great deal of carbonation.  So its kind of like a barley wine too (and Im told theres an even stronger brew coming called Enricos revenge or something like that).  This stuff is syrupy in a good way and cleans out really well for such a powerful drop.  You can smell the whisky coming off it and it has a warming effect.  Quite different to the Bourbon Porter by Emerson even though the concept is similar.  Highly recommended.  I hope they brew it again.",1220313600

He had some very creative descriptions when rating brews; some funny, some very strange, all very entertaining.  I ran across his rating for Icehouse and remembered certain parts of it.  Here is, more or less, his ""review"" of that beer, with some additional fictional parts by me and my own rating of it.  Wherever you are Keith, this ones for you:	 	You trudge along wearily in the middle of a blizzard.  A crude made visor made from cloth does nothing for you as tiny snow pellets sting your eyes.  The snow, the wind, the cold- forcing your eyes to become hot and tear.  In the distance in a secluded forest, you make out what appears to be a crude structure.  You think to yourself that you just may be able to ride out this storm if you could find yourself some shelter.  As you draw closer, its appearance makes itself known.  BEHOLD- A majestic icehouse!  As you sit yourself inside of the structure, you light a lamp to discover a pile of 12 oz. bottles bearing the name Icehouse.  You pour one into a clear stein vessel and notice the medium carbonation that drives away the bubbly white head all too quickly.  Aromas of corn and grass hit the nose as you take in its majestic glory.  It hits your mouth with a weak body, the corn is heavily apparent and has a malt liquor quality to it, but the finish is very inviting, making you want to drink more.  You continue to pound away Icehouse after Icehouse in an orgasmic, raging, drunken fury.  Your worn face from traveling has become one of great joy, all in part from this magical elixir!  Pure drunken bliss seems imminent.  Suddenly, a door opens!  A shadow comes racing towards you!  The creature, part yeti, part drunken frat boy, grabs you by the head and breaks you of your delightful journey in the mind.  Exposing long yellow fangs, it starts tearing away at your face with them.  You shreak in terror as blood comes pouring from your flesh.  Fighting against the monster is useless as it now goes for your neck and starts to drain the life out of you.  One lingering thought enters your mind before your journey into the upcoming void- you should have never entered the icehouse.",1223424000

It is quite complex, full flavored, and definitely deserves its spot in the list of top Doppelbocks.  It could also quite possibly be mistaken for a Porter in a blind tasting.",1175817600

But tonight, during a ""Russian Evening"" at a local hotel this was the closest I could find to a beer a Russian might drink. I was actually pleased. While not being in any way a classic brew, it was softer and fruitier than I had remembered it. The intensity of flavours was somewhat muted by the coldness and the nitro blanket used to create that famous head, but it was pleasant enough. I also had the chance to try a can side by side with the draught. Both are delivered by nitro. There was no difference in taste or mouthfeel. [2.8]	 Aug 2004:  Can.  Head to Head with Murphys Draught, and then with Guinness Original. Obviously rather smooth and bland when served cold and nitrogenated, though some pleasant roast flavours come through. Some vigorous shaking aids in removing the gas. Eventually a fruity and pleasant stout emerges, with a dry acidity. Licorice, oily fish and dark fruit flavours also come through. Its not a bad stout. Its not great either, but deserves some respect. Theres an interesting range of flavours. Ultimately the finish is just too bitter for my taste, and the overall dryness  is not to my personal liking either. Slightly more interesting than the Murphys, but not as palatable.

Initial aromatic impression of hops, with some almost burnt black malt underneath.  then some sweeter, saltier chocolate and light berry-fruit.    First sip is quite hoppy, a bit salty and smokey in a meaty way, bitter as well.   Initial burp tastes of hops.   The flavor mellows as the beer warms.   It becomes sweeter, with dark caramelized sugars, vanilla, light coffee, and a bitter piney finish.   The mouthfeel is definitely light for the style, and in the medium range overall.   This is honestly not quite like any imperial stout that I have had before.   It drinks small, but has a good balance of flavors.   There are more flavor and aroma hops than maybe any stout that Ive had, but they work well to balance the typical malt sweetness of the style and make this really drinkable.   I want to call this an IPA-foreign stout hybrid with way more alcohol that you think.   I like it.",1234224000

Slowly dwindles away to a thin cap of milky film. Lacing in one continuous sheet. Delicious coffee aromas. Not a rough bitter espresso mode, but rather a creamy mocha latte fragrance. Flavors have a subtle char character; roasted barley meets wet doused campfire smokiness. Roasted coffee bean tone. Modest chocolate appearance; mix between syrup and powder. Sweet sugary syrup note followed by a light dusting of cocoa. Dry hoppiness; an airy English character. Finishes powdery dry with an aftertaste of char and smoke.

Long, cereal grain honey taste throughout as this stays fairly sweet until the finish yields a light, earthy and straw bitterness with a pinch of spices.

There was a large,, off-white head that slowly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy Bread, cookie, toasted malt, caramel, light to moderate herbal hops, prune, apple, cherry, toffee,  a little sour fruit and maybe some fig. The initial flavor was sweet, acidic and sour; while the finish was very sweet, acidic, slightly sour and a little bitter with an average duration.

That said this is very enjoyable. As others have noted this is very complex and all over the place all at once. It dances round the mouth with dark fruits and toffee/caramel and lots of other good stuff. Appearance is fantastic. Deep deep red amber body with a beige head that is over just a little too soon but no matter. Tasty looking lace too. My bottle had not been refrigerated at all and as a result the alcohol was quite apparent but in a most pleasing fashion. I should also note that this particular bottle was past the sell by date by five months so the bottle fermentation has had plenty of chance to do its thing and it shows. I am not getting the fizzyness that plenty of others have noted but maybe it is the age of this sample. I found it smoth and creamy and dangerously quaffable. Finish is creamy slighty bitter with a lick of alcohol and over just a little too quick. Damn my glass has finished.

The wood tones are actually very nice; very dark, smokened to an extent, crisp, heavy, and cedary with just a nudge of citrus. Unique roasty/toasty bread malting too that worked well together.		Great smooth and warm body, nearly full, fairly creamy, lots of dark wooded and heavy heated hop oiling out in the finish. Nice smokey, earthen, woody hops in this one.

Deep alcohol coated raisins in the aroma, along with concentrated vanilla extract, extremely bitter piney hops and a hint of soft fruit.  Delicate and tightly bubbled carbonation that is fantastic.  Flavours are pretty well rounded, robust; but may be a bit too sharp: bitter orange rinds, pine, sugary alcohol, plums, and raisins.  Solid beer now, I cant wait to enjoy these in the years to come.  7/4/8/5/15		12 oz bottle, (aged ~18 months): modest light brown cream a top a muddy, red-mahogany body.  The complexities I remember in the aroma have condensed into a thick, piney caramel sludge, that seems to stick to not only my nose hairs but the flesh of my face.  Swirling the glass revives the creamy foam and releases strange cooked, gassy veggie aroma.  All of the bitterness has disappeared and been replaced with caramelized raisins and plums.  The little over 1 year of age has treated this one well and actually tastes a bit older and even more developed.  A great treat after a nice meal.  8/4/8/5/18		12 oz bottle, (aged ~ 2 years): the beautiful mahogany body has turned darker with hints of rust.  The thin cream has turned darker as well.

The body is lightly hazy, showing a crimson-merlot tint and capped with a small patch of beige colored foam.  Blobby sheets of lacing cling to the glass.  The aroma gives sweet-tart, acetic balsamic notes, along with a lactic, creamy cheesiness and hints of dried out dark fruits.  It smells a little sugary, with some of those fruits and sweet vanilla barrel combining to overtake the acetic element.

It has an acidic and tart aroma that is slightly funky like B.O.  This beer is dry with some caramelized malt and a mild bitterness.  It has a medium-full body and is smooth, complex, and well-balanced.  This is a very good beer.	750 mL bottle (Batch 267/268).  Rating #240 for this beer.	. . . . . . . . . .	8/08/2008:  E. S. Bam smells of sweet and sour citrus (grapefruit) with grapes, sugar-cookie/caramel-like malt, and a tinge of the tasty trademark Jolly Pumpkin funk.  This beer has a hazy amber brown (more brown than amber) appearance with a large, whipped beige-colored head that leaves dense lacing (a lot like that of a nitro-induced brew) on the glass and never fully collapses.  There is a generous flurry of carbonation visible as well.  The flavor is light, dry, and refreshing.  It starts out much like an American or English Pale Ale with a generous showing of balanced caramel/toffee maltiness and fruity/lightly citrusy hoppiness with a mild to moderate level of bitterness.  The sour and tart woody funkiness comes through about mid-palate and than fades through the finish leaving an earthy, grassy, citrusy (peel), and slightly spicy lingering hop flavor in the mouth along with some lemongrass and something that brings water chesnut to mind...  Anyways, this beer has a medium to medium-full body and a fairly mellow palate like a true ESB or Bitter would have.  This is a really well-crafted beer that does a very good job of balancing all the great Jolly Pumpkin characteristics with an ESB-styled beer.	750 ml. bottle (Batch 267, 268) from Jungle Jims International Market in Fairfield, Ohio.

Herbal, black tea-like and light floral hops. The nose is near fantastic - elegant mild roast, dark berries (black cherries, dark grapes and blackberries), ripe fruitiness and spicy sugar/vanilla hints. The only downside is the too strong phenol touch. Maybe some mint bubblegum, plums and cardamom/cinnamon. The flavour is near medium sweet and light bitter.

I say that as some one with no real brewing knowledge and who is blissfully unaware of the difficulties in making organic beer, versus non-organic beer (one mans opinion).		This beer pours a pretty dirty amber body with minimal head formation.  It looks like a lot of IPAs once they get to old...unappetizingly cloudy and a bit syrupy.  Aroma is a thick sweetness.  Flavor is fairly IPA-like and pretty good, although certainly not best-of-style.  Mouthfeel is a little thick.

The flavor and aroma of this extra pale ale is intense creamed corn, with a side dish of cardboard and perhaps some peppery spice.  Theres a mild bitterness toward the finish, but it doesnt have much impact or make much of an impression because the corn flavor and aroma is so dominant.  Light to medium body.  Like other extra pale ales Ive sampled, this is medium yellow in color, and its ever-so-slightly hazy in appearance.

The nose isnt as impressive as the flavor, being mostly grainy, a bit toasty, and lacking the balancing hops we get in the flavor.  Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel, perhaps just a bit too zesty from carbonation, and with the bitter hops providing a crisp, cleansing finish.  Golden amber in color, plus a slight haziness.  At least an inch of off-white head forms during the pour, and the head maintains a thin layer throughout the session, leaving a large rim of lace at the top of the glass, with scattered patches below.

A large, foamy, uniform coffee head forms and settles to a thin blanket.  Thick sheets of microfilm lace coat the glass entirely.  The aroma is roasty, though not as intensely aromatic as I was expecting.  Big time coffee and chocolate dominate, with scorched caramel and faint piney hops playing second fiddle.  Anise and dark fruits emerge as it warms.  The flavor is considerably more bold than the nose indicates.  Bitter coffee, bakers chocolate, and resinous hops thrash the palate right off the bat.  Moderately sweet caramel rushes in to sooth, followed by copious amounts of oatmeal smoothness.  The finish lingers for ages, with pine resin and intense roast seemingly inseparable from the tongue.  Best mouthfeel Ive ever encountered in a beer.  This stuff is as full as it gets, silky smooth, and not in the least bit cloying.  Excellent brew.

Big and bold. Maybe a hint of toffee in there too. Super smooth rich malty body. Slightly sweet caramel coating a touch of chocolate and cream. Smooth and silky on the tongue.

Taste: Toasted grainy maltiness wrapped up in plenty of toothsome crystal and candied caramel sweetness. Hearty hoppiness tasting of ruby red grapefruit, papayas, and white pine sap. While you do get a sturdy bitterness, sure, theres enough gooey maltiness present that it comes across as no more than easy-going and downright smooth.  Vein of peppery alcohol persistently running through the flavor. Warming, bittersweet finish.		Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Theres a slight sugary stickiness to the mouthfeel.

Body is adequately malted with just enough toasted caramelized malts to provide a decent body without being heavy.  Hops are very woody, again like the nose it is more than the typical coniferous/pine-tree flavours.  Here the hops feel woody at large.  Also a citric astringency.

Dark, solid black with a thin head- one of the darkest brown heads Ive yet seen on a beer. Leaves a nice lacing down the glass that dissipates over time. First smell, so many different notes that I have to take multiple sniffs. Aroma is of roasted coffee, vanilla beans, ginger, lots of wood, nuts. With a scent like this I cant wait to taste it. First sip... very malty, a bit sour, lots of brown ale taste and some toastiness of a porter in there as well. Sweet notes, and a lot of spicy ground pepper feel on the finish that leaves the mouth a bit tingly. This is a fantastic experience. Going in depth with the flavors... Lots of sweet ginger, toasted woody malt, roasted coffee, chocolate, some hop bitterness there as well as I get acquainted with this beer... Fruit notes- plum, raisin, other dark fruits that I cant quite put my finger on. There is so much to talk about, this is by far the most complex beer Ive ever had. The kicker for me is the spicy finish along with the severe alcohol warming effect without any semblence of an alcohol bite whatsoever even at 13% ABV. This is a superb, perfectly made beer.

Flavors of all the herbs used in the brew, white pepper, and lemon. No funk detected. No barnyard or horseblanket. Has a very minty note, which is almost like cough drops.  Disapointing as a saison, probably better if consumed with food, like a leg of lamb or something. A little too savory for a beer.  An interesting experiment, but not totally successful.",1305072000

Though this is no sloutch to say the least. Pours a dark chetnut hued red. A bit of foam forms upon finishing but it diminishes nearly competely on standing a moment as is common in the style. This is a tasty but simply sweet malt-monster with the flavors that come with it--raisin, molasses, plumb, caramel and maybe some toffee. The mouthfeel isnt particularly thick or interesting though there is a pleasing dose of bitterness in the finish along with some roasty chocolate notes. The most impressive feature of this fine beer is how amazingly smooth and easy drinking it is at nearly 10% ABV--I wont but I could seriously chug this stuff. This is really a wonderful thing in a high gravity beer. It shows the brewers put the pateince and respect into the beer by letting it age at the brewery for extended periods. Bravo! Let this baby get real nice and warm--close to room temp--before you drink it. A certain elegant complexity comes out at higher temperatures.

The alcohol is of course present in the finish as well, lasting for a good while.

Wheat comes through as a backdrop, with just a touch of buttery toffee for sweetness.  Immediately, though, the bitter hops take over and dry things out like an oven.  Orange and grapefruit burst through on the palate, accompanying the grassy, resinous flavors.  The body is medium in stature and extremely crisp.  The moderately long finish is dry and bitter.

The recipes have all been recreated this time around and I sat down to sample all of them. This beer still reigns as the worst of the bunch.  However, it was great to see the incremental formation of this beer making it hard to actually blame the brewer.  The beers building up to this (Anniversary 8-10) were doing a decent job.  Ignore the fact that having a mish-mash of different hops and malts is a silly basis for a beer, they all came off fine and getting better with each new year.  But they reached a saturation point here. They tried to ferment this baby real well to pump up that abv and  it ended up in an alcoholic mess, yet well attenuated.  I like the idea but the results were not a winner.  Afterward, the Anniversary brews all started to have a lot more sugar covering up the alcohol, a necessity for such a beer.  The first time I had it I was very upset, second go around its not quiet as bad.  I also did not get that really shitty leafy hop messiness, must have gotten a better crop of hops this time. 6/3/6/3/13,  Final rating is a combination of the two. 		I always look forward to the Hebrews anniversary releases and so far have not been disappointed. Every year they were able to make a similar yet different and more importantly, good beer.  However, that tradition has finally come to an end.  The beer smells like an alcoholic bitter-leaf mess.  Taste is slightly less bad with too much bitter leaf hops and prune alcohol.  Body is way too light and there is no malt backbone to the strong alcohol and massive amounts of hops.  The only thing this beer has in common with its previous versions is its black body and the very entertaining label. Couldnt drink too much of this, just one malt and one hoppy to much this year.5/3/6/2/1122oz bottle, Rodenbach GC glass.",1194480000

Taste is fruity and sweetish, the hop bitterness and resin doesnt set in until the end, and even then its relatively mild.  Hops, caramel, grapefruit, and faint oranges and pineapple.

Flavor is sweet and citrusy.  Grapefruit gives way to buttery sourdough.  Body is thick and oily, heavy on the palate; almost greasy.  Solid malt stronghold effectively balances all 100+ IBUs.  Warm glow at the back of the throat is the only hit of alcohol outside of aroma.  Slightly astringent at the corners of the mouth in the aftertaste, but nothing that detracts.

Aroma is very heavy of citrus.  This beer definitely has a very very unique taste.  It starts off with a fair amount of caramel sweet malt taste and ends with a very piney flavor.  One unique aspect of the beer is the citrus flavor is really prevalent from start to finish trying to meld with the other flavors.  The citrus resembles a sweet lemon flavor as opposed to an acidic citrus seen in some other beers.

I have not been too disappointed with dundees other products.  Im hoping the pale ale will be better than most pale ales Ive encountered.  Pours a little darker than your typical pale yellow american beer. Perhaps even a little brown, but definitely transparent.  Has the hoppy, slightly fruity, aroma of a good beer that lends itself to possibly be a little more than a simple macro.  Upon first taste this beer is somewhat similar to the initial impression I get from weaker IPAs.  The IPA impression fades within a minute or two to reveal well behaved pale ale.  I dont think much of pale ales, but I think I am finally beginning to adapt to the hoppy style. This is better than Great Lakes Burning River and is on par with Lancaster Amish and Flying Dog Pale Ale.  Flavor of bitter grapefruit peel.  Again, this is reminiscent of a mild IPA.  I dont recall the other american pale ales being this bitter. Finish has a slight astringent bite but does not linger for too long.",1167004800

It has the same coppery hue and lightly creme caramel coloured head.

On the medium side of light-bodied, its almost creamy on the tongue with a crisp, fairly clean and mildly bitter finish. Like the aroma, the flavor follows the traditional formula for the style with a slight degradation of the malt profile at the finish; the body and flavor fade a bit at the swallow becoming a bit seltzer-like.

While the palate possesses a little more in terms of hop character, it is still lacking, for the style.  Mild to moderate bitterness, overshadowed by a very prevalent, but not completely out-of-character, English crystal malt residual sweetness.  The finish is also slightly off, lacking the clean finish of better examples of the style, and again perhaps showing that this particular sample was a bit long in-the-tooth.

6,65888,92,Saranac Brown Ale,Brown Ale,4/5,8/10,17/20,5/5,Chad9976,8/10,"Its funny how a little bit of a difference can go a long way. Saranac Brown Ale reminds me a lot of Sam Adams Scotch Ale in that they both have a very roasty, almost smoky taste to them. The difference being Saranacs taste is well-balanced while Sam Adams is overwhelming. I was actually expecting a sweeter beer, but a beer with a significant, balanced roasted flavor thats smooth suits me just fine.   POUR, COLOR AND AROMA   Considering the name, its no surprise Saranac Brown Ale pours to a medium brown/reddish hue, not unlike Newcastle Brown Ale. It forms a caramel-colored, fairly creamy head which lingers for a little while but leaves no lacing on the glass.   There isnt much scent to this beer other than a fairly standard malty aroma. However, from the aroma alone you can tell this beer is going to have a roasted flavor.   TASTE   Once again I seem to have done a beer a disservice by drinking it at too cold of a temperature. Straight out of the fridge, Saranac Brown Ale has an upfront taste of roasted hops and sweet malts. The label advertises a chocolate taste but I think the roastiness is the definitely element to the flavor. Also, there seems to be just the slightest hint of a smoke flavor to its palate, but maybe I tasted something else.    The beer has something of a bonus to its taste in that it sweetens significantly as it warms up. Id like to give it another try by drinking it at a warmer temperature from the get-go, but Ill have to wait for the next Saranac mix pack. UPDATE: I did drink it warmer and it was MUCH sweeter!FINISHSmooth as can be, Saranac Brown Ale is a craft beer with the drinkability of a mass-market light lager. The mouthfeel is very soft and inviting, especially considering the flavor.It finishes very clean with almost no bite. Anybody should be able to drink this beer no problem.   BODY  Since this is an ale its no surprise its medium-bodied without being too filling. At 6% ABV, it would seem to be a much heavier beer, but its surprisingly light. This would likely make a great session brew.  FINAL THOUGHTS   One of my all-time favorite beers is Newcastle Brown Ale, and even though Saranac Brown Ale isnt quite the same, it does have similar characteristics. Those looking for an easy-to-drink ale thats not too filling would be wise to give this beer a try.NOTE: watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogeNvL-yUj8",1271289600

When this beer first appeared on my radar it was the top rated Saison.  I see its now listed as a Sour, and despite having qualities of both, this seems more appropriate.  Citrusy fruity flavors, herbal notes, wild flowers, some lactic sourness, lemon drops, wheat, and again, just a dash of that bourbon from the aroma.  Im not exactly sure what that is.  The palate is spot on and delicate, offering a crisp spiciness with thirst quenching sour citrus, all in a unique package.  Nice beer.  This really is interesting with some unique flavors.

I liked this just a little bit more than the regular Dark Lord- while the vanilla bean sweetness overwhelmed some of the subtleties of the beer, it provided a solid backbone off of which the other flavors blended beautifully. In addition to the vanilla, I tasted a little more chocolate and less coffee in this version. The beers arent poured with the optimal head at DLD, so I cant quite comment on the appearance, but it doesnt seem to lose any of the viscosity, etc. from the regular DL. Again, considering how intense the beer was, I found it a lot more drinkable than expected- the abv is noticeable, but I would not have guessed at 14%; does a good job of masking that. The burn on the way down is more pronounced than in the DL and it ends with a syrupy fullness. Beautifully done.

Forgetting all the hype that its not ready just yet and it needs a few weeks to settle, its better than anything as it is. This beer has everything you want in Imperial Stout and then some. Ladies and Gents (and fellow RBers) the bar has been raised. Go figure a brewery in Indiana does it. Not that Dreadnaught isnt good (its better than Ruination to me), this beer is fantastic. 		Flavors? The chocolate, vanilla, raisins and dried fruits all intermingle to provide sensory overload. The malty sweetness combined with the bitter hoppiness, make this the stuff legends are made of. Viscosity (I got that from a Castrol commercial) of light chocolate syrup. This stuff coats your glass like dirty oil does to your oil pan. There is residue all over the place. If my tongue were an inch longer, I would have licked the bottom and sides of my pint glass. 		To any other brewer that reads this review, its time you stop fucking around and get in the game, especially if you are currently brewing Imperial Stout. We all know legends like Gretzky, Jordan and Woods only come around once in a lifetime, but before them there was Howe, Chamberlain and Nicklaus. Therefore, now that this new milestone has been created, its time to think outside the box. If you make it, they will pay for it. You brewers have a responsibility to educate the public and increase the publics awareness. Most of you are brewing bullshit and you know it. Be the best. You have the tools, knowledge and ability. To steal a phrase from Nike, Just Do It. This beer is not only great, but has inspired me to not only do better at my job but be a better person in life. Finally, to the genius that concocted this liquid brilliance, I love you, man. 			In rating the 2005 version, I wasnt so impressed as last year. I found it to be a bit sour and not as good as Speedway.",1080172800

6.5,1432,231,Three Floyds Alpha King,American Pale Ale,3/5,9/10,18/20,5/5,GarrettB,8/10,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 A brewery has to be mighty confident to name one of its own beers with a compound of two flattering titles.  King suggests a monarchial patriarch steeped, thanks to the popularity of democracy, in mystique and mythology.  An ultimate if foolish authority - the highest form of legal impunity.  But then to borrow some equally alluring and scholarly Greek to legitimize the regal appellation with the language of the ancients  it shows no lack of gall, and a high risk of extreme gaucherie.  But they did it.  They made a beer entirely deserving of its name and more.  The more pale ales I drank at the GABF the more I realized its a style I dislike, but there were a handful that stood out.  They were the last bastions of quality in hops, and leading the pack was the Three Floyds Alpha King.  It was more than tolerable.  It was divine (gives a whole new meaning to divine right to rule).  Similar to the distantly related pale ales that sprawled across the festival floor like a plague of locusts, the Alpha King glowed brightly in a simple clear and gold garb topped with a thin laurel of off white foam.  Nothing extraordinary, but if the appearance was mundane then the aroma was exceptional.  The first smells to hit the olfactory are whipped cream and berries.  These punch into the nostrils, followed by the spine melting aromas of creamed honey, genuine ripe grapefruit, and a bouquet of wildflowers.  All of these heavenly, bellowing whiffs of dessert follow suit on the tongue, though taking an ancillary role tip-toeing on the palate behind bubbly and springy hops and floral qualities.  The key here is a balance.  Too many breweries think hopping up their beers and quantifying IBUs in scientific notation makes for an extreme experience.  And many drinkers think this is tantamount to a pleasing experience.  Since this is becoming the rule Ive progressively felt more and more ostracized from the pale ale community.  But the Alpha King, in his just and benevolent rule, has welcomed me back to a court where balance and focus make for the finest beer.  Its well textured, well flavored, well scented, well balanced and generally well made.  It is, in my mind, the finest pale ale available and justly deserves its eminent title.",1159574400

There were notes of spices such as pepper, coriander and cinnamon represented as well. Wow, this was a real nose banquet. The body was medium-full with lively carbonation and a creamy texture. There was a moderate alcohol warmth in the finish. The flavor started off lightly sweet with all the spiciness mentioned in the aroma plus a slight oak wood cask edge and tawny port presence. The finish flavor was moderately bitter and long lasting.",1138579200

Aroma of hops, guava, pineapple, caramel, corn and a bit of sugar - odd indeed. Light-bodied; Hoppy taste of herbal and grassy hops with a resiny touch and a light bit of tropical fruits later, the beer envelops to a malty, almost oaky dryness. Aftertaste is subtle but efficient - hops definitely make the most of the taste with some light sweetness offsetting the hops a touch. Overall, a less than stellar IPA, but one that was better than I was expected and frankly, one that is better than some others by places youd expect to have better beers.

British brewers exported these rich, robust, potent stouts to Czarist Russia in the 19th Century. These beers were big, roasty, hoppy brews, that were higher in alcohol than dry stout. These beers were meant to be winter warmers, and they are quite strong, avb usually ranges from 8-10%. This has become a recognized sub style of stout, and many American breweries brew this style of beer. Brooklyn BBC is a great example of this style. It has everything an Imperial Stout should have, it is roasty, hoppy, and is very warming. This beer is also very chocolatey, hence the name		Brooklyn BCS pours to a ink black color with a slight tan head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is awesome, just packed with huge malt and hop aromas. Dark chocolate, sweet malt, expresso, hints of vanilla, piney hop aromas and waves of peppery alcohol flood the nose. The palate is HUGE. This is a rich, decadent beer. Flavors of dark chocolate, cocoa,expresso coffee, sweet malt, vanilla, and a touch of licorice coat the tongue. The body is very viscous, thick, and oily. This beer resembles motor oil. BCS finishes with more chocolate malt character up front, then dries to a long, roasty, bitter, warming, high octane burn.		This is a true sipping brew. It is so rich and delicious. It has an amazing bitter sweet chocolate character, you would swear they used real chocolate in this beer, but this feat is done by malts alone. This is a phenomenal desert beer. I would match this with a rich devils food cake, dark and milk chocolates, or chocolate covered strawberries.",1138147200

Further Personal Perceptions:	-A ring of foam circles the reddish marroon.	-The black currant fruitiness and well developed chocolatey malts are a wonderful match.	-The finish is an agile blend of sourness, dry brett wilderness and lingering juicy fruit.	-The mouthfeel is lush and effervescent.

Somewhat of a murky, cloudy appearance that could be chill haze, with very little in the way of head or head retention.  Caramel sweet aroma with hints of sourdough bread underneath.  Light carbonation and a relatively thin mouthfeel.  Caramel sweet aroma also translates over to the finish.  Some might complain that the bodys a little thin on this but I think it works fine in the parameters of the beer and the style in which it is working.  Theres also a surprising amount of bitterness to be found in the middle of this beer, though the huge caramel finish overpowers that relatively quickly.  Lemony citrus hops also help to cut the sweetness of the finish.  This beer is all about the malt profile  which is good because its  very decent and enjoyable.

Thick mouthfeel that spreads in layers along the palate.  Finishes with hints of cinammon, nutmeg, and a touch of coriander, all washed in peat smoke.  As it warms, the peat and smoke become more prominent.

It was delightful to find it at the Haight. Pours amber with a white head. Has the aroma of 1N Acetic Acid. This is a very very sour beer. Its like sweet tarts sour without the sweet. No lacing as I suspect the ale actually solubilized parts of the glass that contained it. This is far closer to battery acid than anything Ive had from NB before. Way too astringent for everyone at my table. Some even refused to taste it after smelling it. Obviously, I loved it. UPDATE 12/2006: The amazing Beertopia in Omaha now carries this in the big bottle. Im still holding out for the kegs. UPDATE 1/2007: ON tap at the brewery hospitality house. The battery acid burn remains disturbingly strong. I can get a wisp of oak flavor out of the huge sourness. The aroma is no where as vinegar as it was at Toronado. The color is a dark auburn. Theres still a residual chemical burn palate. If you work it, you just might get apricots in the nose. This beer could make an astringent beer cry. Id guess the pH is 3.7. UPDATE: New Belgium tasting at Max & Joes Tavern on 10/18/7. Seems like it has a very fruity aroma now not unlike grapes.

A big spiciness kicks in for the finish along with a slight hop resin. What lingers on an on is a medium residual hop bitterness and a ton of spicy hop flavor.

Tiny bubbles course upwards in the minimally hazy (leaving plenty sediment behind) liquid, supporting the fully lasting head.  Lacing proceeds down the glass in sheets.  Cant ask for much more in appearance.Snappy phenols bound upwards from the yeast, as honey-filled pils malt joins the game.  A strong shot of grassy, herbal hops dries things out, with white and black pepper lingering on the finish.  The yeast is delightfully unique and characterful, just what I remember from the amber version.  It almost defines a biere de garde, giving it that soft, yet distinct mineral character, light almond nuttiness and acidity and an almost cellar-like/musty band-aid character (borderline band-aid).  With the minty, lively, assertive hops, its quite a complete picture in the nose, sporting a high strength of aroma to-boot.  Neither alcohol nor any pils malt brewing flaws (DMS, vanillin, corn-like notes) are present.Succulent honey notes, dripped over fresh, gooey baguette are quickly matched by freshly picked herbal notes coming from the hops.  Dill and mint, oregano and parsley, whatever you want to call it, its dripping with flavor (and a moderate amount of bitterness) and certainly amped up from many of its contemporaries.  Belying the malt strength (in the realm of a double pils), is the tight, invigorating carbonation that breaks up any palate fatigue (certainly aided by the hops) and delivers an engaging experience to the last drop.  The extraction is wonderfully done and the yeast shines strongly on the finish, with notes of almonds, buttercream, strong, slightly bland minerals and plasticy band-aids that I find in the amber Bavai.  No alcohol in flavor, maybe a slight, slight hint of butter.Taken as a blonde belgian ale, or a strong pils, it most certainly comes off too sweet, though taken as a unique creation, in the modern, hoppy, quasi-Biere de Garde sense, it delivers a refreshing charm and uniqueness, or so I think.",1162857600

Not a bad beer, but not approaching a 4.0.  Looks black with an impressive creamy firm head, tan, and lasting at 1"".  The head sticks to the side like a thick sheet of chamois-like lace.  The head feels fluffy against the upper lip as the beer flows underneath with medium to full body.  The first sip evidences milk chocolate lingering in the finish.  Further examination: initial burst of fleeting confectioners sweetness gives way to creamy liquid roastiness in the flavor, but the least dry roastiness I have ever experienced.  Theres also unsweet chocolate powder, which should also be dry but also gets subsumed in the milky creaminess.  Under that is a molasses flaovor mixed with some weird rancid oatmeal funk that is not good at all.  As I continued to drink the beer, the funk became the only thing I could focus on; it really detracted from the experience.

The aroma has a lot of ginger and something that seems to be like vanilla mint.  The flavor has some light caramel maltiness with some ginger and faint vanilla mint.  It is on the sweeter side overall and the ginger flavor grows with each drink.  A light alcohol burning sensation is noticeable through the nose.  The body of this beer is average and it is smooth on the palate.  I enjoyed this beer, but would like to try it again becase as with most Belgian beers, Im sure that I missed some of the flavors and other complexities that this beer has to offer...	750 ml corked and caged bottle (10.5% alc/vol.) shared by Rob at our weekly/bi-weekly beer tasting.  Thanks for sharing this bottle with me.  I appreciate it!  Rating:  7/3/8/3/15=3.6	3/28/2009:  Wow, I think that this dirty gold-colored beer has gotten better with age!  The combination of candied ginger (maybe even a touch of pickled ginger too!), cherries, sweet toffee malt, spicy honey, white wine, and a hint of oxidation really makes for a good synergy in both the aroma and the flavor.  This beer is thicker and more full-bodied than I previously remember, but that helps to keep the high alcohol hidden and provides a great mouthfeel.  This beer has aged very nicely over the past 5 years.  However, it might be just about ready to peak, so dont hold into it too much longer.  Enjoy it now while its still great!  I bet that this beer would pair really well with just about any artisan cheese...  If only I had some on hand to enjoy!	1 pt. 9.4 fl. oz.  corked and caged bottle (10.5% alc/vol.; March 3, 2004) purchased from Dilly Deli Wines & Gourmet in Mariemont, Ohio.  $7.99+tax at the time...

Needing something that was not a porter, stout, or sour beer I reached for it.  Its what you would expect in a pale ale done properly and well worth trying if you run across it.  At $1.50 a bottle the price tag is not much more than some of the cheap swill but you get a drinkable and flavorful product instead.		Aroma / Appearance  - The thick dense head and caramel orange body presented the ideal of an American pale ale.  Caramel drizzled brownie teased the nose along with Wurthers hard candy and mellow hops.  Warm and inviting it strikes a balance between maltiness and hoppiness.		Flavor / Palate - The resiny bite that comes with the first sip dominates from the start.  It is not until this finishes its journey at the back of the throat that the pine, almond, and shortbread make themselves evident.  Much richer than I expected this is certainly a worthwhile beer.

The flavors were out of this world, by far the best coffee stout I ever have experienced to date. I think this one will set the bar. I came of like a good French vanilla roast.

Pours reddish copper with no head, only a small rim of white foam in the edges. A lot of yeasty flakes, though. Aroma starts off with a mix of oxidation, oak and and a subtly peated whisky note. Very port wine, sherry-like character given by the oxidation and oak. Plums, or rather prunes, raisins and  figs as well. Very complex nose, but the oxidation and the peat dont play that well together. The taste is a classic, heavily sweet English barley wine. Loads of caramel, dark fruits, prunes, dates, white raisins. The oxidation is there, but not as much as in the aroma. The barrel is mostly noticeable in the finish and the after taste. The smoke is very subtle, and lies beneath the whole spectrum of the beer, and the peat is incorporated very well. I am not much of a sucker for these thick English barley wines, but the smoke does a proper job of leeching some of the sweetness and giving a bit (a tiny bit) of balance to the sweet side.

Presumably intended to complement spicy food such as Vindaloo curry (the programme notes actually suggested Chilli & rice).  Well, if your idea of a drink to quench a searing hot curry is something that is easy to tip down your neck when the burn kicks in and is not encumbered with too much flavour or body to interfere with that function, I guess this could be for you. On the other hand, water would probably fit those criteria equally well. Amber colour. Clean enough. A bit thin. Quite dull but entirely inoffensive. Just a bog standard session bitter really.

Here goes...Pours a clear, rusted ruby orange body with a very thin, tan head that immediately disappears into nothing. Leaves just a few bubbles around the edges. A simple swirl does arouse a quickly fading head in my snifter. Aroma is big and very rounded. Deep, rich, sweet, and kind of sticky raisin malts and maple syrup. The booze is clearly present, but very well hidden by the sweetness of the malts. A mead-like honey aroma, toffee cookies, and a bit of apricot. Before even trying this, I bet this could age for many more years simply because the malts are so sweet. And I feel the same way about the flavor. Very sweet. Definitely reminiscent of a mead. Sweet and sugary honey with some nuts and toffee. Very sweet caramels, dates, maple syrup, brown sugar, and some raisicots (raisin-apricot) before finishing with a light earth and loads of sweetness. An underlying booze stays very sweet throughout with a light aged wood quality to it. The booze is actually very hidden by the massive amount of sweetness. Finishes silky and slowly dries before leaving a light cloying feel. Medium body with a moderate aftertaste of sweet maple syrup, honey, dates, and just a light booze flavor. Overall, this could easily age for 5-10 more years. Its still very sweet, but maintains a nice assortment of flavors. I look forward to getting my hands on some other vintages to compare.",1245974400

Head is virtually nil - though swirling the contents in the snifter arouses a thin tan head. The head disappears mostly, but leaves a thin translucent haze of tan bubbles over the deep brownish ruby liquid. No lace on the glass. The aroma is has a very pronounced smell of sweet malt - strong with caramel, toffee, and molasses. There are also aromas of dark, dried fruit and very soft traces of earthy, fruity hops. The taste starts very sweet with hints of maple and vanilla cream. The middle of the tongue begins to find soft and dark fruit, the tickle of mild carbonation, and hints of bitterness from the hops - but still sweet. The finish is sweet like candy - like caramel candied figs or molasses covered dates. There are also hints of vanilla and nut in the finish - but mostly sugary sweet malts. The mouthfeel is quite thick, almost syrupy, but somewhat lightened by suds. Normally I enjoy strong beers with more dimensions (greater array of complex flavors, more hops, etc...) - but despite this beer being a one-dimensional power-house of malt, it is quite alluring and delectable.

Body is opaque black (flashlight tested). Aroma is moderately to heavily malty (roasted/burnt grain/coffee, bitter chocolate), lightly to moderately hoppy (resin, grapefruit), with notes of raw wood and alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Full body, creamy texture, soft/lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Very similar to the regular Oak Aged Yeti, maybe a little less hop presence and a little more burnt coffee character, but the differences are relatively minor.  A bit more acidity, perhaps.  Regular Yeti still beats all the variations Ive tried so far.  The oak chips kinda bring down the aroma with a raw, clumsy wood smell, and the coffee doesnt really add much to the roastiness that plain Yeti already has...and even seems to add a slightly unpleasant overly burnt character. Awesome appearance as always, though.",1223769600

Pours black with a tan one finger head that lingers.  Maintains nice lacing throughout.  The aroma was comprised of malt and coffee beans.  The flavor was of malt and massive coffee.  It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation.  Overall it was a pretty nice for a coffee flavored Russian Imperial Stout.  The coffee was overwhelming in flavor though and most likely covered up a lot of the subtle flavors that might have been present.

When jercraigs invited a few of us over for tasting session, I figured that I would hit #500 that day, so I decided to bring this along to share the love. The question was: would this world-renowned beer reach our expectations? Colour is rich mahogany with a slight cloudiness and a prefect beige head. Aroma is full and appetizing with notes of sugar, raisins, molasses, cinnamon, plum pudding and gingerbread. Warm, full mouthfeel. The flavour is less complex than expected, but still remarkable in its balance and uniqueness, holding sweet fruity malts, worldly spices, and some hints of dark rye bread.

But here goes...  It poured a teak colour with amber highlights and a towering pillowy head that took an eternity to sag back into the Maudite chalice. (And never entirely disappeared.) Clumpy lacework spackled the glass. The aroma was surprisingly light for the 8% abv and dominated by yeast. The key notes were grape bubblegum, fresh dough, ginger and dark rum. (It sparked a scent memory of the ginger beer I brewed when I was around 12 years old. A couple of bottles blew their caps and sprayed the bedroom cupboard where Id stupidly stored them, so I lived with the smell for months...) Its medium bodied and the mouthfeel is smooth and a little oily, with a terrific afterburn as it slides down the gullet. The finish is dry and spicy. The flavour is initially sweet and malty. Theres plenty of fig-like dark fruit before the peppery alcohol kicks in. Minor criticisms: this sample is arguably too fizzy in the mouth for the style (may have suffered from the journey) and Im not sure it carries its alcohol quite as easily as some of the other Trappist 8s.

Aftertaste shows a lot of hops still, plenty of alcohol and a malt that lasts and lasts. Overall, a good beer - strong in hops and a bit too strong in other characteristics. Too much of an IIPA to be a special beer, ESPECIALLY at the stupidly expensive price of $20 for the 75 cL bottle. I sampled my bottle purchased from Joes Place in Oklahoma City, OK on 22-May-2007, but I wouldnt buy it again.",1179792000

A small, fizzy, off-white head leaves virtually no lacing behind.  The aroma is classic IPA all the way, with fresh orange and grapefruit hops showing atop a sweet, rich caramel malt base.  The flavor is essentially the same, though I noted that orange overtook grapefruit as the dominant hop component.  Slightly more substantial than medium bodied, this brew is smooth and easy drinking.  Finishes short and well balanced between sweet and bitter.  Ample aromas and flavors put this one just shy of an IIPA, in my opinion.  Damn solid brew.",1198195200
4.8,580,96,Rogue Morimoto Soba Ale,Specialty Grain,4/5,8/10,14/20,3/5,soulgrowl,8/10,"Aroma: Nice. More hoppy than I anticipated, with a pointed citrusy edge. The soba is subtle to the max, bordering on being undetectable... but its there, sweet and wheaty. Theres also a scent of honey and, surprisingly, quite a bit of buttery diacetyl. I want to say this beer kind of smells like pancakes, but that doesnt do it justice. Its more complex than that.		Appearance: The color reminds me of jasmine green tea, a clear, burnt, earthy yellow. Head is white and fluffy/seafoamy, and it sticks around quite a while.		Flavor: Good stuff, but not as good as the smell. You can definitely taste the soba, especially in the aftertaste; its a rich, grainy, nutty flavor. Fruity hops are pronounced very clearly, and the buttery taste is also very strong. This would go well with - what else? - soba. Especially zaru (cold) soba. It would also be great with fried rice, or any teppanyaki dish. I like the idea of having it with yakisoba, but Im afraid yakisoba sauce might overpower this delicate brew.		Palate: A bit flat and weak-bodied, but theres a bit of graininess in the texture that matches the flavor very well. Finish is nice and dry, with the hops and the soba hanging around long after you swallow.		Overall: This is a nice, subtle, light-bodied beer with a unique flavor. Very drinkable, although it is a tad on the pricy side.",1210118400

Large 2 finger head is somewhat pillowy, off-white Baileys Irish cream colored, and has medium retention duration. 			AROMA: Malty, some earthy/spicy hops, subtle wood aroma, some vanilla-like characteristics from the wood (though more like vanilla extract than vanilla bean), and faint spice. Good amount of wet cereal grain. Wood aroma is somewhat off  like some old cheap wood; hardly as pleasant as some other oak aromas that I have experienced. Unable to discern much whiskey notes on nose. Some light char aroma, which was somewhat pleasant. As it warms up, aroma exhibits much more old wood (unpleasant) as well as faint whiskey notes (pleasant). 			TASTE: Malt, cereal, and some hops dominate. 		Light vanilla as well as some faint taste of old wood on mid palate. 		Back of palate has subtle whiskey note. 		Faint copper/metallic taste on finish. 		Some bitterness on finish. Hops on finish as well as back of palate seem somewhat spicy with light earthy notes. Finish also has a faint spice character that seems like a combination of spice tastes from the hops as well as the barrel. 		MOUTH FEEL: On the lighter side of medium bodied. Crisp, nice carbonation. Semi-dry. Extremely faint alcohol warmth  likely it is this discernable at this abv because the body is quite thin. 			OVERALL: Expected more whiskey notes on aroma and taste. Plenty of cereal taste. Overall, like slightly bitter cereal. Unable to say am biggest fan of the style, though found it ok. At the least, the complexities from light barrel aging can be appreciated. Wanted to like it more than I did. Brilliant concept; less than spectacular execution. Perhaps if both the whiskey as well as the beer (at their separate stages) were aged in the barrel longer, this would be a more interesting beer. According to Rogue: the whiskey only sits in the barrel 30 days, and the beer only sits in the used whiskey barrel 2+ months  each stage could have been longer.",1300579200

Plain golden color with a very middling head on my pour.  My first whiff suggested olives, for some reason, but that was just a ghost.  The label calls this a classic English pale ale, but in fact this one deserves to be categorized as an American pale ale.  The aroma is strongly, classically American Western microbrew hopping, but there is a substantial maltiness that makes it seem like it has real strength (not barleywine strength but headed at the top range of the pale ale).  I agree that the flavor is distinctly malty, but this is not to diminish the semi-piney, dirty bitter hop flavor.  The palate is a bit weak, seeming watery when chilled, slightly more syrupy when warmer.  Didn't do it for me, especially as I had it with an expensive home-grilled steak ($11 N.Y. strip, free from a grocery store offer)--it just couldn't match in quality the other foods I started to eat along side it.",1066262400

Only a touch of brown sugar and milk chocolate sweetness peaks in.  Bitterness peaks around a 2-3.  Light to moderate carbonation with a smooth body.

The colour is pretty dark with some red hues, plenty of ultra light brown bubbly head and some messy lacing. The aroma is an immediate mix of two things: fresh yet subdued hops and coffee grinds. Sadly I was really disappointed with this much coffee stuff. Fragrant and pungent, orange and roast, resin, light light chocolate. Ok, I gave up on this and drank the last 400ml of the Fish Tale Swordfish - there is no comparing these beers. Swordfish is hugely hopped and has zero coffee which for me is awesome. Now, the match up isnt actually a fair battle as these beers are quite different in their make up but, hey, if you just want to look at how much I enjoyed the two, this beer would never be bought again. That is not to say that this beer sucks - its good but not as good.... at all. Wow. my dick is going to split in half like a boiled hot dog if I dont hit up the can. HUBs got some good flavours though - fruity stuff, lots of roasted malts, coffee dullness, big hard bitter finish. I wonder what the real goal of this style is... maybe this is a truer version and the Swordfish was just tastefully hopped. The last pour gave a great compact light stout head equal in compactness to the Swordfish. I think now that I only have this beer left it is getting better than it was. The coffee has faded and the hops are taking over... which is not what I would have expected.. then again, its  colder now and yea, eya, that makes sense. Who cares? Now Im enjoying this immensely. And Im slurring my thought and I have a massive batch of popcorn coming up and I have the 3rd period of the LA/SJ game to finish on PVR with the 2006 Oilers/ Canes final to watch on replay. There is 1% less in this beer vs its competitor. I dont recall what I typed already and Im not going to reread it as Im spending way to much time retyping most of my words. MOre pine and some spice and bite on this one. Finishes feeling thick in spots and thinner in others. A solid mean bitterness with a defined coffee malt aftertaste lingers like unwanted relatives drinking your liquor. I can smell the oil, that means time to add the popcorn and time to assume that I wont go to bed until well after 1:30. I wont buy this again as there are better options. The difference between the 4.1 Swordfish and the 3.3 here are firstly in enjoyment and secondly in bluntness.I wonder how long this review is?",1303689600

Finish is mildly dry with a touch of citrus. For a Pale Ale that has been dry hopped theres just no evidence of hops. I know I drink alot of US brew, but I still drink Ale in pubs 3 times a week, so Im not that biased, this just hasnt got anything to sink your teeth into. As a quaffing refrshing beer on a hot day its fine, but dont expect anything more than that. Id say it has more in common with a Malty German Lager than with a UK/US Pale Ale. Palate is light and slightly gassy, but the conditioning has definitely gotten better since the Fathers Folly.  Its encouraging, but I wish people would stop putting stuff about US beer on their bottles if they dont have a beer inside that can compare (even just a little bit) to a US brew. I want new breweries like this one to do well, especially as the Baltic Stout is a decent beer, but sometimes youve got to wonder if the brewers are actually tasting the beer inside the bottles during writing up the blurb on the outside, as sometimes there seems to be a blatant mis-match... Putting US beer to one side, this doesn;t even have the hop profile of a UK plae ale, the mlts have come to the fore, perhaps this is teething troubles if this is a new beer? Sorry, would like to be more positive, but being constructive with critiscism sometimes is all the positivity I can give.",1282176000

Black chocolate bars brittle and pure, espresso beans, burnt wood, and a wisp of black root in the back. Char also lingers in the back for a heavy long finale of fudge mingled with black cherry skins. Dark fruit pits for some nutty earthiness. Vanilla bean here and there. Nice richness overall to the nose.		Palate: as nose promised, so did she deliver. Smooth with a medium bodied middle and a long finish. Mouthcoating. Nip of dark fruit and black cherry tartness comes in after each quaff is long gone. Burnt essence lingers long atop tongue with pure black cacao and chunks of fudge. Fudge also coats lips. Burnt wood, ash, and char underneath. Licorice root leads into more fudge while faint warmth lingers in the chest.

Here, the attempt is not too convincing. The pale yellow pour reminds of a witbier whose head shows little endurance. From there, youre entering a linear flavour profile whose focus is on the spices. Its precisely what it says it is. With effort, you can pick up all the individual spices written on the label and with almost each one, you have an after-thought that there was a little too much of that one (and especially cinnamon, a spice of which there almost seems to be too much from the first milligram added into an hectoliter).

An earthy hoppy finish and a creamy mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. This is a very balanced imperial stout although perhaps on the sweet side.

The head is small and fine.  The color is a goldenrod/darker shade of yellow, the typical american standard color.  Theres quite a bit of carbonation, and that can be a problem after the third bottle as it begins to be cumbersome and redundant.  The start has a sweet aftertaste, but that seems to dissappear at the end of the bottle.  Overall this beer is light and easy drinking as well as refreshing.  If I could change anything about this beer, I would back off on the carbonation as it gets in the way of the little taste it does have.  This is one my preferred American style beers.",1032220800
