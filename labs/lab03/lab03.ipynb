    "Regular expressions are a mainstay of working with text. They can be used to *quickly* find matches of expressions in strings, but with `wildcard' characters so that we don't need to know exactly what we're searching for. In a technical sense, a regular expression takes a pattern and automatically builds a special-purpose little program that is used to search text to match that pattern. We won't discuss the details of how these work&mdash;this is done in most beginning theoretical computer science courses&mdash;but we'll get some practice using them in Python.\n"
